  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>...
  </ul>

  <li>...
  </ul>

<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> improvements and bug fixes:
  <ul>
  <li>...
  </ul>

<li>LibreSSL version 3.8.2
  <ul>
  <li>Security fixes
    <ul>
    <li>Disabled TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 in libssl so that they may no longer
      be selected for use.
    <li>BN_is_prime{,_fasttest}_ex() refuse to check numbers larger than
      32 kbits for primality. This mitigates various DoS vectors.
    <li>Restricted the RFC 3779 code to IPv4 and IPv6. It was not written
      to be able to deal with anything else.
    </ul>
  <li>Portable changes
    <ul>
    <li>Extended the endian.h compat header with hto* and *toh macros.
    <li>Adapted more tests to the portable framework.
    <li>Internal tools are now statically linked.
    <li>Applications bundled as part of the LibreSSL package internally,
      nc(1) and openssl(1), now are linked statically if static libraries
      are built.
    <li>Internal compatibility function symbols are no longer exported from
      libcrypto. Instead, the libcompat library is linked to libcrypto,
      libssl, and libtls separately. This increases size a little, but
      ensures that the libraries are not exporting symbols to programs
      unintentionally.
    <li>Selective removal of CET implementation on platforms where it is
      not supported (macOS).
    <li>Integrated four more tests.
    <li>Added Windows ARM64 architecture to tested platforms.
    <li>Removed Solaris 10 support, fixed Solaris 11.
    <li>libtls no longer links statically to libcrypto / libssl unless
	    <code>--enable-libtls-only</code> is specified at configure time.
    <li>Improved Windows compatibility library, namely handling of files vs
      sockets, correcting an exception when operating on a closed socket.
    <li>CMake builds no longer hardcode <code>-O2</code> into the compiler flags,
      instead using flags from the CMake build type instead.
    <li>Set the CMake default build type to <code>Release</code>. This can be overridden
      during configuration.
    <li>Fixed broken ASM support with MinGW builds.
    </ul>
  <li>New features
    <ul>
    <li>Added support for truncated SHA-2 and for SHA-3.
    <li>The BPSW primality test performs additional Miller-Rabin rounds
      with random bases to reduce the likelihood of composites passing.
    <li>Allow testing of ciphers and digests using badly aligned buffers
      in openssl speed using -unalign.
    <li>Ed25519 certificates are now supported in openssl(1) ca and req.
      Prepared Ed25519 support in libssl.
    <li>Add branch target information (BTI) support to amd64 and arm64
      assembly.
    </ul>
  <li>Compatibility changes
    <ul>
    <li>Added a workaround for a poorly thought-out change in OpenSSL 3 that
      broke privilege separation support in libtls.
    <li>Moved libtls from ECDSA_METHOD to EC_KEY_METHOD.
    <li>Removed GF2m support: BIGNUM no longer supports binary extension
      field arithmetic and all binary elliptic builtin curves were removed.
    <li>Removed dangerous, "fast" NIST prime and elliptic curve implementations.
      In particular, EC_GFp_nist_method() is no longer available.
    <li>Removed most public symbols that were deprecated in OpenSSL 0.9.8.
    <li>Removed the public X9.31 API (RSA_X931_PADDING is still available).
    <li>Removed Cipher Text Stealing mode.
    <li>Removed ENGINE support, including ECDH_METHOD and ECDSA_METHOD.
    <li>Removed COMP, DSO, dynamic loading of conf modules and support for
      custom ex_data and error stacks.
    <li>Removed proxy certificate (RFC 3820) support.
    <li>Removed SXNET and NETSCAPE_CERT_SEQUENCE support including the
      openssl(1) nseq command.
    <li>ENGINE support was removed and OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE is set. In spite
      of this, some stub functions are provided to avoid patching some
      applications that do not honor OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE.
    <li>The POLICY_TREE and its related structures and API were removed.
    <li>In X509_VERIFY_PARAM_inherit() copy hostflags independently of the
      host list.
    <li>Made CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index() not return 0 to allow applications
      to use *_{get,set}_app_data() and *_{get,set}_ex_data() alongside
      each other.
    <li>X509_NAME_get_text_by_{NID,OBJ}() now only succeed if they contain
      valid UTF-8 without embedded NUL.
    <li>The explicitText user notice uses UTF8String instead of VisibleString
      to reduce the risk of emitting certificates with invalid DER-encoding.
    <li>Initial fixes for RSA-PSS support to make the TLSv1.3 stack more
      compliant with RFC 8446.
    <li>Fixed EVP_CIPHER_CTX_iv_length() to return what was set with
      EVP_CTRL_AEAD_SET_IVLEN or one of its aliases.
    </ul>
  <li>Internal improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Improved sieve of Eratosthenes script used for generating a table
      of small primes.
    <li>Removed incomplete and dangerous BN_RECURSION code.
    <li>Imported RFC 5280 policy checking code from BoringSSL and used it
      to replace the old exponential time code.
    <li>Converted more of libcrypto to use CBB/CBS.
    <li>Started cleaning up and rewriting SHA internals.
    <li>Reduced the dependency of hash implementations on many layers of
      macros. This results in significant speedups since modern compilers
      are now less confused.
    <li>Improved BIGNUM internals and performance.
    <li>Significantly simplified the BN_BLINDING internals used in RSA.
    <li>Made BN_num_bits() independent of bn->top.
    <li>Rewrote and simplified bn_sqr().
    <li>Significantly improved Montgomery multiplication performance.
    <li>Rewrote and improved BN_exp() and BN_copy().
    <li>Changed ASN1_item_sign_ctx() and ASN1_item_verify() to work with
      Ed25519 and fixed a few bugs in there.
    <li>Lots of cleanup for DH, DSA, EC, RSA internals.  Plugged numerous
      memory leaks, fixed logic errors and inconsistencies.
    <li>Cleaned up and simplified various ECDH and ECDSA internals.
    <li>Removed EC_GROUP precomp machinery.
    <li>Fixed various issues with EVP_PKEY_CTX_{new,dup}().
    <li>Rewrote OBJ_find_sigid_algs() and OBJ_find_sigid_by_algs().
    <li>Improved X.509 certificate version checks.
    <li>Ensure no X.509v3 extensions appear more than once in certificates.
    <li>Replaced ASN1_bn_print with a cleaner internal implementation.
    <li>Fix OPENSSL_cpuid_setup() invocations on arm/aarch64.
    <li>Improved checks for commonName in libtls.
    <li>Fixed error check for X509_get_ext_d2i() failure in libtls.
    <li>Removed code guarded by #ifdef ZLIB.
    <li>Plug a potential memory leak in ASN1_TIME_normalize().
    <li>Fixed a use of uninitialized in i2r_IPAddrBlocks().
    <li>Rewrote CMS_SignerInfo_{sign,verify}().
    </ul>
  <li>Bug fixes
    <ul>
    <li>Correctly handle negative input to various BIGNUM functions.
    <li>Ensure ERR_load_ERR_strings() does not set errno unexpectedly.
    <li>Fix error checking of i2d_ECDSA_SIG() in ossl_ecdsa_sign().
    <li>Fixed aliasing issue in BN_mod_inverse(). Disallowed aliasing of result
      and modulus in various BN_mod_* functions.
    <li>Fixed detection of extended operations (XOP) on AMD hardware.
    <li>Ensure Montgomery exponentiation is used for the initial RSA blinding.
    <li>Policy is always checked in X509 validation. Critical policy extensions
      are no longer silently ignored.
    <li>Fixed error handling in tls_check_common_name().
    <li>Add missing pointer invalidation in SSL_free().
    <li>Fixed X509err() and X509V3err() and their internal versions.
    <li>Ensure that OBJ_obj2txt() always returns a C string again.
    <li>Made EVP_PKEY_set1_hkdf_key() fail on a NULL key.
    <li>On socket errors in the poll loop, netcat could issue system calls
      on invalidated file descriptors.
    <li>Allow IP addresses to be specified in a URI.
    <li>Fixed a copy-paste error in ASN1_TIME_compare() that could lead
      to two UTCTimes or two GeneralizedTimes incorrectly being compared
      as equal.
    </ul>
  <li>Documentation improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Improved documentation of BIO_ctrl(3), BIO_set_info_callback(3),
      BIO_get_info_callback(3), BIO_method_type(3), and BIO_method_name(3).

      undocumented.
    <li>Made it very explicit that the verify callback should not be used.
    <li>Called out that the CRL lastUpdate is standardized as thisUpdate.
    <li>Documented the RFC 3779 API and its shortcomings.
    </ul>
  <li>Testing and Proactive Security

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.4/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install74.img</i> or <i>miniroot74.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install74.img</i> or <i>miniroot74.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy74.img</i> or <i>floppyB74.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot74.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.3 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade74.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<section id=sourcecode>
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_4</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.4 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
