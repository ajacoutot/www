<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20211101">2021/11/01 - sndio(7) descriptor format change</h3>

If you explicitly pass audio device descriptors to programs (through
program options or through the <code>AUDIODEVICE</code> environment variable),
then the descriptors might need to be updated as follows.
Otherwise, skip this section.

<p>
Audio devices exposed by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sndiod">sndiod(8)</a>
are not bound to physical audio devices anymore,
so the physical audio device number component of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sndio">sndio(7)</a>
descriptors was removed.
For instance, if the server is started with:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>sndiod -f rsnd/0 -s foo -f rsnd/1 -s bar</b>
</pre>

then programs will need to use
<code>"snd/foo"</code> and <code>"snd/bar"</code> (instead of
<code>"snd/0.foo"</code> and <code>"snd/1.bar"</code>).

<p>
By default programs will try to use <code>"snd/default"</code> (instead
of <code>"snd/0"</code>).
Unless <code>-s&nbsp;default</code> option is used,
<code>"snd/default"</code> is automatically created and attached to
the first physical audio device specified on the command line (i.e. first
<code>-f</code> or <code>-F</code> option).
If needed, this setting may be changed at run-time with the
<code>server.device</code> control exposed by
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sndioctl">sndioctl(1)</a>.

<p>
For each physical device managed by the server (i.e. each <code>-f</code>
or <code>-F</code> option) the server also exposes a
<code>"snd/&lt;number&gt;"</code>
descriptor bound to the physical device of the same number.
Consequently, <code>"snd/0"</code>, <code>"snd/1"</code>, ...
still can be used to refer to specific physical devices.


<h3 id="r20211103">2021/11/03 - xterm(1) mouse support disabled by default</h3>

Mouse support was disabled by default in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xterm">xterm(1)</a>.
It can be re-enabled by adding the following to .Xresources:

<pre class="cmdbox">xterm*allowMouseOps: true</pre>
