Following -current and using snapshots

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20231017">2023/10/17 - ncurses updated to 6.4-20230826</h3>

First build and install libraries, then build and install usr.bin/tic,
finally make build as usual.

<blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/src &amp;&amp; make obj
cd /usr/src &amp;&amp; make includes
cd /usr/src/lib &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
cd /usr/src/usr.bin/tic &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
cd /usr/src &amp;&amp; make build
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20231128">2023/11/28 - [packages] PostgreSQL major update</h3>

<p>
There was a major update to PostgreSQL 16.1.
Use <tt>pg_upgrade</tt> as described in the
<a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/ports/databases/postgresql/pkg/README-server?rev=1.36&amp;content-type=text/plain">postgresql-server pkg-readme</a>
or do a dump/restore.


<h3 id="r20240126">2024/01/26 - libcxx update</h3>

libcxx has some headers moved around so a cleanup is required before
make build.

<blockquote><pre>
rm -rf /usr/include/c++/v1
cd /usr/src &amp;&amp; make build
</pre></blockquote>
