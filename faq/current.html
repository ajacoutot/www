Following -current and using snapshots

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20240424">2024/04/24 - bgpd removal of 'announce capabilities'</h3>

The <code>announce capabilities [yes|no]</code> neighbor config option
needs to be removed from configuration files. 
To replace <code>announce capabilities no</code> one can use:
<blockquote><pre>
announce as-4byte no
announce refresh no
announce restart no
announce policy no
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20240507">2024/05/07 - smtpd table protocol change</h3>

The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a> table protocol
was changed to
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd-tables.7">smtpd-tables(7)</a>.
The old packages <code>opensmtpd-extras</code> should be removed and the
appropriate tables installed from the <code>opensmtpd-table-*</code>
packages.
For example, the passwd table is in the <code>opensmtpd-table-passwd</code>
package.
Once the new tables are installed, no changes to the configuration
are needed.
