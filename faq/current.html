Following -current and using snapshots

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20220521">2022/05/21 - deprecation of ${rcexec} in rc.d scripts</h3>
The ${rcexec} variable used to start daemons with rc.d(8) has been replaced with
a more complete rc_exec() function.
Handcrafted rc.d(8) scripts must be modified to use this new function:
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>sed -i 's/\${rcexec}/rc_exec/' /etc/rc.d/myscript</b>
</pre></blockquote>
Compatibility will be retained until next release.

<h3 id="r20220423">2022/04/23 - switchd(8) removed</h3>
switchd(8) has been removed from the base system.
To cleanup the no longer needed user, group and files execute the following
commands:
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>userdel _switchd</b>
# <b>groupdel _switchd</b>
# <b>rm /etc/rc.d/switchd /usr/sbin/switchctl /usr/sbin/switchd \
  /usr/share/man/man4/switch.4 /usr/share/man/man5/switchd.conf.5 \
  /usr/share/man/man8/switchctl.8 /usr/share/man/man8/switchd.8</b>
</pre></blockquote>
