Following -current and using snapshots

<hr>

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20230711">2023/07/11 - [packages] databases/influxdb upgrade to v2.7</h3>


<p>
The <tt>databases/influxdb</tt> port was upgraded to a new major version,
which has several impacts:
<ul>
<li>the <tt>influx</tt> CLI command is now in a separate <tt>influx-cli</tt>
package, and has a completely different syntax</li>

<li>authentication is now mandatory via token, and the db is multi-tenant so an
organization is also mandatory</li>

<li>the web interface is now built-in and accessible on port 8086 by
default</li>

<li>the database format needs to be upgraded (cf <a
href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.7/upgrade/v1-to-v2/automatic-upgrade/">the
upstream documentation</a>):

<blockquote><pre>
# doas -u _influx influxd upgrade
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>this will:
<ul>
    <li>convert the existing <tt>/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf</tt> into
                <tt>/var/influxdb/.influxdbv2/config.toml</tt></li>
    <li>convert the data from <tt>/var/influxdb/{data,wal,meta}</tt> into
    <tt>/var/influxdb/.influxdbv2/{engine,influxd.bolt,influxd.sqlite}</tt></li>
    <li>once properly upgraded, the v1 config/files can be safely removed</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>during upgrade it asks for l/p/org/default bucket/retention policy, that'll
also generate a client config in <tt>/var/influxdb/.influxdbv2/configs</tt>
that's used by <tt>doas -u _influx influx</tt> command afterwards for setup.
The latter also contains a token for the admin</li>

<li>for new installs, running the following will asks the same questions:
<blockquote><pre>
# doas -u _influx influx setup
</pre></blockquote></li>

<li>telegraf clients need to be updated to use <tt>outputs.influxdb_v2</tt>
plugin (with org, token and bucket) per <a
href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.27/plugins/outputs/influxdb_v2/README.md#configuration">the
documentation</a></li>

<li>no more collectd direct sink in influxdb, collectd now needs to talk to a
telegraf with a <a
href="https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.9/data_formats/input/collectd/">collectd-enabled</a>
sink. An example configuration for <tt>telegraf.conf</tt> is provided below:

<blockquote><pre>
[[inputs.socket_listener]]
  service_address = "udp://:25826"
  data_format = "collectd"
  collectd_auth_file = "/etc/collectd/collectd.auth"
  collectd_security_level = "encrypt"
  collectd_typesdb = ["/usr/local/share/collectd_types.db"]
  collectd_parse_multivalue = "split"
[[outputs.influxdb_v2]]
 urls = ["http://influxdb:8086"]
 token = "$DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN"
 organization = "$DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG"
 bucket = "$DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET"
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3 id="r20230726">2023/07/26 - pfsync changes</h3>

<p>
<a href="//man.openbsd.org/pfsync.4">pfsync(4)</a> has been rewritten.
In most cases, no change is needed, and the protocol is compatible
with the older version, however if you are configuring it with a
hostname.pfsync0 entry like <tt>up syncdev $interface</tt> (where
the interface is brought up before configuring it), it must be
rearranged so that the interface is configured first:

<blockquote><pre>
syncdev $interface
up
</pre></blockquote></li>


<h3 id="r20230901">2023/09/01 - [packages] sysutils/borgbackup/1.2 update to 1.2.6</h3>

<p>
A flaw in the cryptographic authentication scheme in <tt>borgbackup<1.2.5</tt>
allowed an attacker to fake archives and potentially indirectly cause backup
data loss in the repository. <tt>borgbackup>=1.2.5</tt> enforces checking the
TAM authentication tag of archives at critical places, and now considers
archives without TAM as garbage or an attack.

<p>
Steps you must take to upgrade a repository are detailed in <a
href="https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/blob/1.2.6/docs/changes.rst#pre-125-archives-spoofing-vulnerability-cve-2023-36811">the
documentation</a>.


<h3 id="r20230906">2023/09/06 - [packages] Tor Browser update to 12.5.3</h3>

<p>
As of the 12.5 release, <tt>torrc</tt> has been moved from
<tt>~/TorBrowser-Data/torrc</tt> to <tt>~/TorBrowser-Data/Tor/torrc</tt>.
If you wish to preserve your tor configuration (e.g., bridges),
please do the following BEFORE starting <tt>tor-browser</tt> after you upgrade:

<blockquote><pre>
  $ mv ~/TorBrowser-Data/torrc ~/TorBrowser-Data/Tor
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20230909">2023/09/09 - [packages] sysutils/borgbackup/1.1 removal</h3>

<p>
The <tt>1.1</tt> branch of <tt>borgbackup</tt> is end-of-life, and has been
removed from ports. Upgrading packages using <tt>pkg_add -u</tt> will result in
<tt>borgbackup-1.1.18</tt> to be replaced by a release from the <tt>1.2</tt>
branch, which at this time is <tt>borgbackup-1.2.6</tt>.

<p>
Before upgrading it is recommended to follow the <a
href="https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/blob/1.2.6/docs/changes.rst#upgrade-notes">upgrade
notes</a>.


<h3 id="r20231001">2023/10/01 - [packages] Exim port changes</h3>

<p>
Exim's internal SPF support has been disabled due to a int underflow
vulnerability in the library used for SPF processing.
If using SPF checks directly in Exim you'll need to disable that
part of configuration (you may be able to replace this with checks
in spam filtering software; at least rspamd and spamassassin can
do SPF checks).

<p>
Exim's AUTH_SPA (NTLM) support has been disabled in the port, to
match upstream's default.
