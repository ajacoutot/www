<h3>Donations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
The OpenSMTPD project is developed by volunteers and is not backed up by a commercial entity.

<p>
As a general rule, you can help the project by donating to the
<a href="https://www.openbsdfoundation.org">OpenBSD foundation</a> whose goal is to fund
OpenBSD and related projects, including LibreSSL upon which we rely. The donations make
the OpenBSD infrastructure better and lets OpenBSD organize hackathons where we tend to
do a LOT more work than usual.
