	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> firewall:
  <ul>
  <li>Added display of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> fragment reassembly counters to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/systat.1">systat(1)</a>.
  </ul>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
<ul>
  <li>IPsec support was improved:

  <li>...
  </ul>

  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
   <li>Repair a withdraw desyncronization problem in bgpd(8).

      in all cases.
   <li>Double peer description length to 64 characters.
   <li>Improve handling of bgpd AFI IPv4 sessions over IPv6 only links.
   <li>Sessions over IPv6 link-local addresses are now always considered
      to be connected.
   <li>Allow operators to enforce the presence of certain capabilities.
   <li>Improve capability negotiation and remove 'announce capabilities'.
      The 'announce capabilities [yes|no]' neighbor config option needs to be
      removed from configuration files. Instead individual capabilities
      need to be disabled.
   <li>Improve negotiation of the multi-protocol capability and the fallback
      to IPv4 only mode.
   <li>Mark RTR and IPv6 BGP packets with DSCP CS6 (network control).
   <li>Increase RTR PDU limit to 48k and limit number of SPAS to 10'000.
   <li>Convert the remaining session engine parsers to the new ibuf API.
   <li>Various changes to autoconf and portable headers for NetBSD support.
   <li>Filtered prefixes are now included in the Local-RIB if the config
      option 'rde rib Loc-RIB include filtered' is set.
   <li>Add 'bgpctl show rib filtered' to show filtered prefixes.
   <li>Add 'min-version' RTR config option and default to RTR version 1.
      Set min-version to 2 to enable draft-ietf-sidrops-8210bis-14 and
      ASPA support or better define the ASPA table in the config.
   <li>Adjust RTR ASPA pdu parser to follow draft-ietf-sidrops-8210bis-14
   <li>Check the max_prefix and max_out_prefix limits on config reload.
   <li>Fix race condition between TCP-MD5 key removal and session closure
      to ensure all messages are sent with the proper TCP-MD5 signature.
   <li>Fix 'nexthop qualify via bgp' by re-evaluating the nexthops when
      a BGP route is added to the FIB.
   <li>Handle the CLUSTER_LIST attribute according to RFC7606.
   <li>Fix some undefined or non-portable behaviour when handling
      NULL / 0-sized objects.

  </ul>

  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> saw these and more changes:
  <ul>
  <li>Impose <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-sidrops-rrdp-same-origin">same-origin policy</a> for RRDP.
  <li>Introduce <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-spaghetti-sidrops-rpki-ta-tiebreaker">tiebreaking</a> for trust anchors.  This prevents certain forms of replay attack.
  <li>Fix internal identification of CA resource certificates.
  <li>Verify self-signage for trust anchors.
  <li>Introduce a check for filenames as presented by publication points.
  <li>Improved compliance with RFCs 6487 and 8209 for certificates and CRLs.
  <li>Presence of CMS signing-time is now enforced and presence of
    CMS binary-signing-time is disallowed, per RFC 9589.
  <li>Lowered the maximum acceptable manifest number to 2^159 - 1.
  <li>Limit number of validated ASPAs per customer ASID.
  <li>Ignore the CRL Number extension in CRLs.
  <li>Various minor bug fixes and improvements in logging and error reporting.
  <li>Ensure synchronization jobs are stopped when the timeout is reached.
  <li>Fix a corner case in repository handling. If the last RRDP repository
    failed to load, rpki-client would fail to fall back to rsync due to an
    ordering bug in the event loop.
  <li>Improve detection of duplicate file paths. Only trigger a duplicate
    error if a valid path is revisited otherwise a bad CA could prevent
    legitimate files from being considered valid.
  <li>Normalize internal representation of the caRepository to have a
    trailing slash and ensure that the rpkiManifest is a file inside it.
  <li>Avoid a quadratic complexity issue in ibuf_realloc() due to misuse of
    recallocarray(). Transferring a manifest with a large FileAndHash
    list across a privsep boundary could cost significant resources.
  <li>RRDP sessions are periodically reinitialized to snapshot at random
    intervals.
  <li>Signed Prefix List statistics are now only emitted when rpki-client
    is run with -x.
  <li>The -r command line option formerly enabling RRDP has long been the
    default and is now removed.
  <li>The CRL number extension in CRLs is checked to be in the range [0..2^159-1]
    and otherwise the CRL is considered invalid.
  </ul>

  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>Set ORIGINAL_RECIPIENT in the environment of MDA scripts for postfix compatibility.
	<li>Add documentation on the expected behaviour and environment of MDAs.
        <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a> IPv6 address parsing in file-backed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/table.5">table(5)</a>.
  </ul>
<!-- OTHER -->
  <li>Many other changes in various network programs and libraries:
  <ul>
<!-- syslogd -->
        <li>...
<!-- dhcp, rad, ... -->
	<li>Implemented RFC 4191 Default Router Preferences in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rad.8">rad(8)</a>.
<!-- more -->
	<li>Trimmed output of <a
		href="https://whois.openbsd.org/whois.1">whois(1)</a> to suppress some
		uninformative output by default, still accessible verbatim by using
		whois -S.
	<li>Removed obsolete <a
		href="https://whois.openbsd.org/whois.1">whois(1)</a> contact handle
		support.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spamd.8">spamd(8)</a>
		advertise SMTPUTF8 and 8BITMIME extensions in EHLO, fixing potential
		interoperability issues when the real MTA supports those extensions.
	<li>Prevented toctu issues in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a> static file
		serving and auto index generation.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ftp.1">ftp(1)</a> send HTTP
		'Accept */*' headers.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ftp.1">ftp(1)</a> send Host: headers with CONNECT requests when tunneling TLS over an HTTP proxy.

  </ul>
</ul><!-- Routing daemons and other userland network improvements -->

<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> improvements and bug fixes:
  <ul>
  <li>Reduced <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> escape-time default to 10 milliseconds (from 500).
  <li>Added display-menu -M to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> to always turn mouse on in a menu.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> option allow-set-title to forbid applications from changing the pane title.
  <li>Prevented a crash if focusing a pane in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> that is exiting.
  </ul>

<li>LibreSSL version 4.0.0
  <ul>
  <li>Portable changes
    <ul>
    <li>Added initial Emscripten support in CMake builds.
    <li>Removed timegm() compatibility layer since all uses were replaced
        with OPENSSL_timegm(). Cleaned up the corresponding test harness.
    <li>The mips32 platform is no longer actively supported.
    </ul>
  <li>Internal improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Cleaned up parts of the conf directory. Simplified some logic,
        fixed memory leaks.
    <li>Simplified X509_check_trust() internals to be somewhat readable.
    <li>Removed last internal uses of gmtime() and timegm() and replaced
        them with BoringSSL's posix time conversion API.
    <li>Removed unnecessary stat calls in by_dir.
    <li>Split parsing and processing of TLS extensions to ensure that
        extension callbacks are called in a predefined order.
    <li>Cleaned up the MD4 and MD5 implementations.
    <li>Assembly functions are no longer exposed in the public API, they
        are all wrapped by C functions.
    <li>Removed assembly implementations of legacy ciphers on legacy
        architectures.
    <li>Merged most multi-file implementations of ciphers into one or two
        C files.
    <li>Removed the cache of certificate validity. This was added for
        performance reasons which no longer apply since BoringSSL's time
        conversion API isn't slow. Also, a recently added error check led
        to obscure, undesirable validation failures.
    <li>Stopped calling OPENSSL_cpuid_setup() from the .init section on
        amd64 and i386.
    <li>Rewrote various BN conversion functions.
    <li>Improved certification request internals.
    <li>Removed unused DSA methods.
    <li>Improved X.509v3 extension internals. Fixed various bugs and leaks
        in X509V3_add1_i2d() and X509V3_get_d2i(). Their implementations
        now vaguely resemble code.
    <li>Rewrote BN_bn2mpi() using CBB.
    <li>Made most error string tables const.
    <li>Removed handling for SSLv2 client hello messages.
    <li>Improvements in the openssl(1) speed app's signal handler.
    <li>Cleaned up various X509v3_* extension API.
    <li>Unified the X.509v3 extension methods.
    <li>Cleaned up cipher handling in SSL_SESSION.
    <li>Removed get_cipher from SSL_METHOD.
    <li>Rewrote CRYPTO_EX_DATA from scratch. The only intentional change of
        behavior is that there is now a hard limit on the number of indexes
        that can be allocated.
    <li>Removed bogus connect() call from netcat.
    <li>Uses of atoi() and strtol() in libcrypto were replaced with
        strtonum().
    <li>Introduced crypto_arch.h which will contain the architecture
        dependent code and defines rather than the public opensslconf.h.
    <li>OPENSSL_cpu_caps() is now architecture independent.
    <li>Reorganized the DES implementation to use fewer files and removed
        optimizations for ancient processors and compilers.
    </ul>
  <li>New features
    <ul>
    <li>Added CRLfile option to the cms command of openssl(1) to specify
        additional CRLs for use during verification.
    </ul>
  <li>Documentation improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Removed documentation of no longer existing API.
    <li>Unified the description of the obsolete ENGINE parameter that
        needs to remain in many functions and should always be NULL.
    </ul>
  <li>Compatibility changes
    <ul>
    <li>Protocol parsing in libtls was changed. The unsupported TLSv1.1
        and TLSv1.0 protocols are ignored and no longer enable or disable
        TLSv1.2 in surprising ways.
    <li>The dangerous EVP_PKEY*_check(3) family of functions was removed.
        The openssl(1) pkey and pkeyparam commands no longer support the
        -check and -pubcheck flags.
    <li>The one-step hashing functions, MD4(), MD5(), RIPEMD160(), SHA1(),
        all SHA-2, and HMAC() no longer support returning a static buffer.
        Callers must pass in a correctly sized buffer.
    <li>Support for Whirlpool was removed. Applications still using this
        should honor OPENSSL_NO_WHIRLPOOL.
    <li>Removed workaround for F5 middle boxes.
    <li>Removed the useless pem2.h, a public header that was added since
        it was too hard to add a single prototype to one file.
    <li>Removed conf_api.h and the public API therein.
    <li>Removed ssl2.h, ssl23.h and ui_compat.h.
    <li>Numerous conf and attribute functions were removed. Some unused
        types were removed, others were made opaque.
    <li>Removed the deprecated HMAC_Init() function.
    <li>Removed OPENSSL_load_builtin_modules().
    <li>Removed X509_REQ_{get,set}_extension_nids().
    <li>X509_check_trust() and was removed, X509_VAL was made opaque.
    <li>Only specified versions can be set on certs, CRLs and CSRs.
    <li>Removed unused PEM_USER and PEM_CTX types from pem.h.
    <li>Removed typdefs for COMP_CTX, COMP_METHOD, X509_CRL_METHOD, STORE,
        STORE_METHOD, and SSL_AEAD_CTX.
    <li>i2d_ASN1_OBJECT() now returns -1 on error like most other i2d_*.
    <li>SPKAC support was removed from openssl(1).
    <li>Added TLS1-PRF support to the EVP interface.
    <li>Support for attributes in EVP_PKEYs was removed.
    <li>The X509at_* API is no longer public.
    <li>SSL_CTX_set1_cert_store() and SSL_CIPHER_get_handshake_digest()
        were added to libssl.
    <li>The completely broken UI_UTIL password API was removed.
    <li>The OpenSSL pkcs12 command and PKCS12_create() no longer support
        setting the Microsoft-specific Local Key Set and Cryptographic
        Service Provider attributes.
    </ul>
  <li>Bug fixes
    <ul>
    <li>Made ASN1_TIME_set_string() and ASN1_TIME_set_string_X509() match
        their documentation. They always set an RFC 5280 conformant time.
    <li>Improved standards compliance for supported groups and key shares
        extensions:
        <ul>
        <li>Duplicate key shares are disallowed.
        <li>Duplicate supported groups are disallowed.
        <li>Key shares must be sent in the order of supported groups.
        <li>Key shares will only be selected if they match the most
  	  preferred supported group by client preference order.
        </ul>
    <li>Fixed signed integer overflow in bnrand().
    <li>Prevent negative zero from being created via BN_clear_bit() and
        BN_mask_bits(). Avoids a one byte overread in BN_bn2mpi().
    <li>Add guard to avoid contracting the number linear hash buckets
        to zero, which could lead to a crash due to accessing a zero
        sized allocation.
    <li>Fixed i2d_ASN1_OBJECT() with an output buffer pointing to NULL.
    <li>Implemented RSA key exchange in constant time. This is done by
        decrypting with RSA_NO_PADDING and checking the padding in libssl
        in constant time. This is possible because the pre-master secret
        is of known length based on the size of the RSA key.
    <li>Rewrote SSL_select_next_proto() using CBS, also fixing a buffer
        overread that wasn't reachable when used as intended from an
        ALPN callback.
    <li>Avoid pushing a spurious error onto the error stack in
        ssl_sigalg_select().
    <li>Made fatal alerts fatal in QUIC.
    </ul>
  </ul>

<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the use of
the "<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel</a> -E" command.
If you are at all confused when installing OpenBSD, read the relevant
INSTALL.* file as listed above!

<h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install76.iso</i> or
<i>cd76.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install76.iso</i> or
<i>cd76.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install76.img</i> or
<i>miniroot76.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/arm64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install76.iso</i> or
<i>cd76.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.

<p>
To boot from disk, write <i>install76.img</i> or <i>miniroot76.img</i> to a
disk and boot from it after connecting to the serial console.  Refer to
INSTALL.arm64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/armv7:</h3>

<p>
Write a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install76.iso</i> or
<i>cd76.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install76.img</i> or
<i>miniroot76.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot76.img</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot76.img</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.6/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install76.img</i> or <i>miniroot76.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install76.img</i> or <i>miniroot76.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy76.img</i> or <i>floppyB76.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot76.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.5 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade76.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=sourcecode>
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=ports>
<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_6</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.6 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
