<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> improvements and bug fixes:
  <ul>
  <li>...
  </ul>

<li>LibreSSL version 4.0.0
  <ul>
  <li>Portable changes
    <ul>
    <li>Added initial Emscripten support in CMake builds.
    <li>Removed timegm() compatibility layer since all uses were replaced
        with OPENSSL_timegm(). Cleaned up the corresponding test harness.
    <li>The mips32 platform is no longer actively supported.
    </ul>
  <li>Internal improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Cleaned up parts of the conf directory. Simplified some logic,
        fixed memory leaks.
    <li>Simplified X509_check_trust() internals to be somewhat readable.
    <li>Removed last internal uses of gmtime() and timegm() and replaced
        them with BoringSSL's posix time conversion API.
    <li>Removed unnecessary stat calls in by_dir.
    <li>Split parsing and processing of TLS extensions to ensure that
        extension callbacks are called in a predefined order.
    <li>Cleaned up the MD4 and MD5 implementations.
    <li>Assembly functions are no longer exposed in the public API, they
        are all wrapped by C functions.
    <li>Removed assembly implementations of legacy ciphers on legacy
        architectures.
    <li>Merged most multi-file implementations of ciphers into one or two
        C files.
    <li>Removed the cache of certificate validity. This was added for
        performance reasons which no longer apply since BoringSSL's time
        conversion API isn't slow. Also, a recently added error check led
        to obscure, undesirable validation failures.
    <li>Stopped calling OPENSSL_cpuid_setup() from the .init section on
        amd64 and i386.
    <li>Rewrote various BN conversion functions.
    <li>Improved certification request internals.
    <li>Removed unused DSA methods.
    <li>Improved X.509v3 extension internals. Fixed various bugs and leaks
        in X509V3_add1_i2d() and X509V3_get_d2i(). Their implementations
        now vaguely resemble code.
    <li>Rewrote BN_bn2mpi() using CBB.
    <li>Made most error string tables const.
    <li>Removed handling for SSLv2 client hello messages.
    <li>Improvements in the openssl(1) speed app's signal handler.
    <li>Cleaned up various X509v3_* extension API.
    <li>Unified the X.509v3 extension methods.
    <li>Cleaned up cipher handling in SSL_SESSION.
    <li>Removed get_cipher from SSL_METHOD.
    <li>Rewrote CRYPTO_EX_DATA from scratch. The only intentional change of
        behavior is that there is now a hard limit on the number of indexes
        that can be allocated.
    <li>Removed bogus connect() call from netcat.
    <li>Uses of atoi() and strtol() in libcrypto were replaced with
        strtonum().
    <li>Introduced crypto_arch.h which will contain the architecture
        dependent code and defines rather than the public opensslconf.h.
    <li>OPENSSL_cpu_caps() is now architecture independent.
    <li>Reorganized the DES implementation to use fewer files and removed
        optimizations for ancient processors and compilers.
    </ul>
  <li>New features
    <ul>
    <li>Added CRLfile option to the cms command of openssl(1) to specify
        additional CRLs for use during verification.
    </ul>
  <li>Documentation improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Removed documentation of no longer existing API.
    <li>Unified the description of the obsolete ENGINE parameter that
        needs to remain in many functions and should always be NULL.
    </ul>
  <li>Compatibility changes
    <ul>
    <li>Protocol parsing in libtls was changed. The unsupported TLSv1.1
        and TLSv1.0 protocols are ignored and no longer enable or disable
        TLSv1.2 in surprising ways.
    <li>The dangerous EVP_PKEY*_check(3) family of functions was removed.
        The openssl(1) pkey and pkeyparam commands no longer support the
        -check and -pubcheck flags.
    <li>The one-step hashing functions, MD4(), MD5(), RIPEMD160(), SHA1(),
        all SHA-2, and HMAC() no longer support returning a static buffer.
        Callers must pass in a correctly sized buffer.
    <li>Support for Whirlpool was removed. Applications still using this
        should honor OPENSSL_NO_WHIRLPOOL.
    <li>Removed workaround for F5 middle boxes.
    <li>Removed the useless pem2.h, a public header that was added since
        it was too hard to add a single prototype to one file.
    <li>Removed conf_api.h and the public API therein.
    <li>Removed ssl2.h, ssl23.h and ui_compat.h.
    <li>Numerous conf and attribute functions were removed. Some unused
        types were removed, others were made opaque.
    <li>Removed the deprecated HMAC_Init() function.
    <li>Removed OPENSSL_load_builtin_modules().
    <li>Removed X509_REQ_{get,set}_extension_nids().
    <li>X509_check_trust() and was removed, X509_VAL was made opaque.
    <li>Only specified versions can be set on certs, CRLs and CSRs.
    <li>Removed unused PEM_USER and PEM_CTX types from pem.h.
    <li>Removed typdefs for COMP_CTX, COMP_METHOD, X509_CRL_METHOD, STORE,
        STORE_METHOD, and SSL_AEAD_CTX.
    <li>i2d_ASN1_OBJECT() now returns -1 on error like most other i2d_*.
    <li>SPKAC support was removed from openssl(1).
    <li>Added TLS1-PRF support to the EVP interface.
    <li>Support for attributes in EVP_PKEYs was removed.
    <li>The X509at_* API is no longer public.
    <li>SSL_CTX_set1_cert_store() and SSL_CIPHER_get_handshake_digest()
        were added to libssl.
    <li>The completely broken UI_UTIL password API was removed.
    <li>The OpenSSL pkcs12 command and PKCS12_create() no longer support
        setting the Microsoft-specific Local Key Set and Cryptographic
        Service Provider attributes.
    </ul>
  <li>Bug fixes
    <ul>
    <li>Made ASN1_TIME_set_string() and ASN1_TIME_set_string_X509() match
        their documentation. They always set an RFC 5280 conformant time.
    <li>Improved standards compliance for supported groups and key shares
        extensions:
        <ul>
        <li>Duplicate key shares are disallowed.
        <li>Duplicate supported groups are disallowed.
        <li>Key shares must be sent in the order of supported groups.
        <li>Key shares will only be selected if they match the most
  	  preferred supported group by client preference order.
        </ul>
    <li>Fixed signed integer overflow in bnrand().
    <li>Prevent negative zero from being created via BN_clear_bit() and
        BN_mask_bits(). Avoids a one byte overread in BN_bn2mpi().
    <li>Add guard to avoid contracting the number linear hash buckets
        to zero, which could lead to a crash due to accessing a zero
        sized allocation.
    <li>Fixed i2d_ASN1_OBJECT() with an output buffer pointing to NULL.
    <li>Implemented RSA key exchange in constant time. This is done by
        decrypting with RSA_NO_PADDING and checking the padding in libssl
        in constant time. This is possible because the pre-master secret
        is of known length based on the size of the RSA key.
    <li>Rewrote SSL_select_next_proto() using CBS, also fixing a buffer
        overread that wasn't reachable when used as intended from an
        ALPN callback.
    <li>Avoid pushing a spurious error onto the error stack in
        ssl_sigalg_select().
    <li>Made fatal alerts fatal in QUIC.
    </ul>
  </ul>

<li>OpenSSH 9.8 and OpenSSH 9.9

<p>
To install, write <i>install76.img</i> or <i>miniroot76.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install76.img</i> or <i>miniroot76.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy76.img</i> or <i>floppyB76.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot76.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.5 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade76.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.

<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_6</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.6 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
