<h3>What's New</h3>
<p>
This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 7.2.
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="plus72.html">changelog</a> leading
to 7.2.

<ul>

<li>New/extended platforms:
  <ul>
  <li>Added support for Ampere Altra
  <li>Added support for Apple M2
  <li>Added support for Lenovo ThinkPad x13s and other machines using
	the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 (SC8280XP) SoC.
  </ul>

<li>Various kernel improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Allowed bsd.rd and bsd/bsd.mp to boot on Oracle Cloud amd64 instances.
  <li>Added support for switching from glass console to serial console 
	on arm64 systems that default to glass console.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> automatically allows
	IGMP and ICMP6 MLD packets with router alert option.
	Special allow-opts rules are no longer needed for multicast
	discovery.
  <li>Fixed a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> NULL 
	dereference panic triggered by <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>.
  <li>Implement "show all routes" to print routing tables in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a>.
  <li>Added a method (ESC D) to enter <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> on serial drivers that
	do not have a true BREAK mechanism.
  <li>Added "show all routes" and the ability to show individual routes 
	(e.g. "show route 0xfffffd807e9b0000") to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a>.
  <li>Added a "show swap" command to <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> to help debugging.
  <li>Count dropped network packets due to low memory in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstat.1">netstat(1)</a>.
  <li>Simplified machine command handling in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a>.
  <li>Changed to a simpler formula to calculate a default kern.maxthread
	value: 2*NPROCESS.
  <li>Enabled <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kstat.4">kstat(4)</a>, a
	device that exports kernel statistics that can be read by <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/kstat.1">kstat(1)</a>.
  <li>Added cpu frequency sensors for each core on CPUs that have MPERF/APERF support.
  <li>Merged the UVM swap-backed and object-backed inactive page lists.
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rwlock.9">rwlock(9)</a> 
	implementation to be fair to writers. Previously, readers could grab
	the lock even if writers were waiting first.
  <li>Made the CPU frequency scaling duration relative to the load
	when in automatic mode on battery.
  <li>Fixed luna88k MULTIPROCESSOR kernels booting with CPU modules 
	installed in arbitrary slots.
  <li>Added a missing <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/kqueue.2">kqueue(2)</a> wakeup, found by
	a Go testcase hang.
  <li>Bumped the maximum number of supported CPUs to 256 on arm64.
  <!-- XXX should the following be here (swapper, pmem...) or maybe one entry describing them together? -->
  <li>Ensure uvm_swap_io() can succeed, even in out of memory
	situations, by reserving a second segment for the page daemon.
  <li>Ensured progress in the swapper by pre-allocating pages in a DMA-reachable region.
  <li>Made the page daemon consider pmemrange regions when trying to 
	free pages from the inactive list. Previously the page daemon could
	use a lot of CPU without freeing a page because the global limits were
	satisfied.
  <li>Ensured that uvm_swap_get() will always sleep rather than 
	returning an error. Previously an error could be returned to the fault
	handler which would result in processes dying when a system was under
	a lot of memory pressure.
  <!-- ... up to here -->
  <li>Added support for using non-standard UARTs (such as the Synopsys
	DesignWare UART) as an early console.
  <li>Remove NexGen CPU identification code as the kernel cannot run on these CPUs anyway.
  <li>Remove Rise CPU identification code.
  <li>Dropped detection code for 386sx/386dx CPUs. OpenBSD/i386 hasn't 
	actually supported running on either for some time.
  <li>Dropped detection code for Cyrix CPUs older than the Cyrix M2.
  <li>Implemented the fundamentals for suspend/resume on arm64.
  <li>Simplified TSC synchronization testing on amd64.
  <li>Corrected sparc64 ofwboot to default to the <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a> volume on the 
	boot device to make root on softraid work out of the box on sparc64
	and be more consistent with softraid boot on other architectures.
  <li>Removed the obsolete kern.nselcoll <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2">sysctl(2)</a>.
  <li>Changed mips64, octeon, and loongson to trigger deferred clock
	interrupts from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/splx.9">splx(9)</a>.
	This isolates the clock interrupt schedule from the MD clock interrupt
	code.
  <li>Fixed a potential kernel panic when an msdos partition is out
	of space by fixing instances where msdosfs passed a NULL proc pointer
	to detrunc().
  <li>Add a delay_init() function that helps on i386 and amd64 
	architectures in setting up delay_func for different timers and
	switching between them depending on their quality properties.  This
	improves how timers backing <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/delay.9">delay(9)</a> are managed.
  </ul>

<li>SMP Improvements
  <ul>
  <li>Make route timer MP safe and use rttimer pool.
  <li>Use kernel lock to protect parts of ARP, ND6 and PPPoE that
    are not MP safe.
    Lookup of existing ARP entries is MP safe and can run in parallel.
  <li>Start up to 4 softnet tasks to run IP input and forwarding
    in parallel on multiple cores.
  <li>Run IPv4 packet reassembly in parallel.
  <li>Run IPv6 hop-by-hop options processing in parallel.
  <li>Add a mutex to rate limiting functions to make them MP safe.
  <li>Introduce mutex and reference counter for internet protocol 
    control block.
  <li>Protect <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/udp.4">UDP</a>, raw <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ip.4">IP</a>, and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/divert.4">divert</a> packet input
	routines with a per socket mutex.
  <li>Protect <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/recv.2">recv(2)</a> system call
    for UDP and raw IP packets with a per socket mutex and shared netlock.
    Allows to receive packets while forwarding in parallel.
  <li>Protect multicast deliver loop for UDP and raw IP sockets with rwlock.
  <li>Only grab netlock in IGMP and MLD timer when necessary.
  <li>TCP slow timer runs without netlock.
  <li>Rework rwlock so that a writer will get the lock eventually.
    Readers cannot share the lock forever.
    This prevents starvation of the writer.
  <li>Run interface media ioctl with shared netlock so packets
    can be processed while running
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/btrace.8">btrace(8)</a> can be used
      to debug reference counting.
  <li>Use MP safe refcount for interface addresses.
  <li>Unlocked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kbind.2">kbind(2)</a>.
  <li>Unlocked the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a> system call.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unix.4">UNIX</a> domain 
	sockets locking per-socket rather than coarse locking of the entire
	domain sockets layer.
  </ul>

<li>Direct Rendering Manager and graphics drivers
  <ul>
  <li>Updated <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/drm.4">drm(4)</a>
      to Linux 5.15.69
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/inteldrm.4">inteldrm(4)</a>:
      support for Alder Lake, Raptor Lake
  <li>Reimplemented the TTM page allocation code using <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bus_dma.9">bus_dma(9)</a> APIs to make
	sure DMA addresses are translated properly on architectures with an
	IOMMU. This fixed <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/amdgpu.4">amdgpu(4)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/radeondrm.4">radeondrm(4)</a> on
	powerpc64, sparc64, and arm64 machines with SMMU.
  <li>Implemented support for framebuffers that don't start on a page 
	boundary (like those on the 2021 14" and 16" MacBook Pro).
  <li>Added handling for framebuffers where the first pixel isn't 
	page-aligned to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wsfb.4">wsfb(4)</a>.
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/Xorg.1">Xorg(1)</a> when 
	using the luna88k 1bpp framebuffer hardware.
  </ul>

	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmctl.8">vmctl(8)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> to use bytes for
	memory and disk sizes.
  <li>Fix rebooting a received VM in <a 
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>.
  <li>Have <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> provide
	a copy of bios at 4g boundary, SeaBIOS and newer Linux kernels expect
	it there.
  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>, fix off by
	one in VM memory range check.
  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>, add
	support for MMIO assist. In <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>, send all port I/O
	emulation to userland.
  <li>Have <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> compute
	i8254 read-back command latch from singular timestamp.
  <li>Improve the command line parsing in <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmctl.8">vmctl(8)</a>.
  <li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> allow

	virtual addresses of VCPU state pages after freeing.
  <li>Fix `vmctl send` on Intel hosts by load the vmcs before reading
	VCPU registers in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>.
  <li>Fix `vmctl receive` on Intel hosts by adding an additional fault
	type in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>.
  <li>Add additional <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dt.4">dt(4)</a>
	tracepoints in various <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> codepaths.
  <li>Add <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpd(8)</a>
	AgentX support based around VM-MIB (RFC7666).
  </ul>

<li>Various new userland features:
  <ul>
  <li>Replaced <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.d.8">rc.d(8)</a>
	$rcexec variable with an rc_exec function. <em>This will require a
	mechanical change from <code>${rcexec}</code> to <code>rc_exec</code>
	in rc.d scripts.</em> Kept compatibility to give people a chance to
	fix their custom scripts.
  <li>Introduced a new daemon_execdir variable to <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.d.8">rc.d(8)</a> for changing to a
	specified directory before running rc_exec.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ts.1">ts(1)</a>, a
	timestamp utility.
  <li>Add a new <i>configtest</i> action to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.d.8">rc.d(8)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/rcctl.8">rcctl(8)</a> to check
	configuration syntax of a daemon.
  <li>Added forest (-f) mode to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ps.1">ps(1)</a>.
  </ul>

<li>Various bugfixes and tweaks in userland:
  <ul>
  <!-- openrsync -->
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync.1">openrsync(1)</a> 
	on sparc64 by eliminating a redundant second conversion of the int
	value from little to host endian.
  <li>Added connection timeout functionality to <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync.1">openrsync(1)</a> via the
	--contimeout option.
  <li>Set the default <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync.1">openrsync(1)</a> connection
	timeout that <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> uses
	to 15 seconds.

  <!-- pkg_add -->
  <li>Made use of the fact that repositories are unique objects in <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a> and annotated
	the quirks repository as cached, allowing for a large speed increase.
  <li>Enabled <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a> caching by default.
  <li>Changed the tied algorithm in <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a> to prevent
	O(n^2) behavior when packages contain several hundred copies of the
	same file.
  <li>Added a "processing" message for when <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a> is
	transferring data to inform the user that pkg_add is still working.

  <!-- fdisk -->
  <li>Added missing uuid_dec_le() to init_fp() so <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> -A works on
	big-endian architectures.
  <li>Aligned <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a>
	logic with that used in the kernel to allow the protective EFI GPT
	partition to be in MBR partitions 0-3, not just 0.
  <li>Prevented use of "-u" when <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> is operating on
	GPT formatted disks.
  <li>Stopped telling <a

        regression to allow editing an MBR of all zeroes.
  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> to 
        restrict user actions if neither GPT nor MBR structures can be found
        on the disk.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> print 
	a warning when an MBR partition starts or extends past the end of the
	device.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> print 
	a warning when a GPT partition start or end is outside the usable LBA
	area of the device.

  <!-- btrace -->
  <li>Installed useful <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/btrace.8">btrace(8)</a> scripts in
	/usr/share/btrace.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/btrace.8">btrace(8)</a> 
	execute the END probe upon receiving a SIGTERM signal.

  <!-- netstart/rc -->
  <li>Moved the wait for autoconf interfaces from <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a> to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstart.8">netstart(8)</a> to fix
	tunnel interfaces that depend on working autoconf interfaces.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstart.8">netstart(8)</a> 
	create virtual interfaces up front if specified on the command line.
  <li>Changed <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.subr.8">rc.subr(8)</a> to copy the
	message to stdout when using <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/logger.1">logger(1)</a> to avoid needing
	to check syslog when running in debug mode.

  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kbd.8">kbd(8)</a> so it 
	doesn't fail silently when executed by a regular user.
  <li>In the <i>sndio</i> library, added the function <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sio_flush.3">sio_flush(3)</a> to stop
	playback immediately. Altered <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sndiod.8">sndiod(8)</a> to wait until
	the buffer is drained before closing the device.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xterm.1">xterm(1)</a> use a 
	much safer FD-passing idiom for updating <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/utmp.5">utmp(5)</a>.
  <li>Prevented a crash in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vi.1">vi(1)</a> when cursor key support is
	disabled.
  <li>Updated <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vi.1">vi(1)</a> to apply
	expandtab to the output of a ! command.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1">mg(1)</a> 
	automatically delete trailing whitespace on RET in c-mode and
	auto-indent-mode.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/grep.1">grep(1)</a> provide 
	full context when using match count (<code>-m</code>)
  <li>Added the --null flag to <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/grep.1">grep(1)</a> which makes grep
	print an ASCII NUL byte after the file name to make the output
	unambiguous.
  <li>Fixed multiple memory leaks in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/awk.1">awk(1)</a>.
  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/compress.1">compress(1)</a> 
	to print a more accurate message when -v is used with -k.
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/gzip.1">gzip(1)</a> byte
	counts with 32-bit integers.
  <li>Fixed the growth check in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/compress.1">compress(1)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/gzip.1">gzip(1)</a> in cases of small
	files or files with sufficiently random data.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/timeout.1">timeout(1)</a> -s 
	accept HUP like <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kill.1">kill(1)</a>
	and GNU timeout(1) do.
  <li>Updated capitals and countries in the game <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/quiz.6">quiz(6)</a>.
  <li>Set default sleep value of <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ico.1">ico(1)</a> to 10ms.
  <li>Fixed a bug in <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/cron.8">cron(8)</a> where it could exit
	silently if <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ppoll.2">ppoll(2)</a>
	exited. Now it will log to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/syslog.3">syslog(3)</a> instead of
	stderr.
  <li>Added <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/llvm-profdata.1">llvm-profdata(1)</a> to
	base so that ports can benefit from profiled builds.
  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a> to only 
	attempt to set the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/yp.8">yp(8)</a>
	domainname if it has not been set yet.
  <li>Raised the "staff" login class data-size-cur on arm64 to be the 
	same as that for amd64 in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/login.conf.5">login.conf(5)</a> (1536M).
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/patch.1">patch(1)</a>
	locate-hunk in empty files.
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/patch.1">patch(1)</a> in
	the case of reversing a patch that creates a file.
  <li>Added seconds to the uptime display of <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/top.1">top(1)</a>.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/putenv.3">putenv(3)</a> 
	return an error if the string starts with the '=' character. This
	matches the behavior on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
  <li>Fixed overflow of the number of errors in <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/renice.8">renice(8)</a> by setting error
	instead of incrementing it.
  <li>Removed the "-c" compatibility option from <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vnconfig.8">vnconfig(8)</a>.
  <li>Stopped <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vnconfig.8">vnconfig(8)</a> from
	printing the device name on failure.
  <li>Print a message when <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so.1">ld.so(1)</a> fails inside <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2">execve(2)</a> to clarify the
	failure mode when a dynamic executable is run while /usr isn't
	mounted.
  <li>Improved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bioctl.8">bioctl(8)</a> 
	RAID level parsing to check numeric levels before checking single
	character levels. This allows recognition of RAID 10 as a valid but
	unsupported level.
  <li>Fixed <a

	to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/axppmic.4">axppmic(4)</a>.
  <li>Modified <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pms.4">pms(4)</a> to 
	discard relative movement packets outside of the [-127, 127] range to
	prevent cursor jumps when using the trackpoint on some Lenovo laptops.
  <li>Allowed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spdmem.4">spdmem(4)</a> 
	to attach to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/loongson/gdiumiic.4">gdiumiic(4)</a>.
  <li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spdmem.4">spdmem(4)</a>
	attach on 2F-based loongson systems.
  <li>Added power button support to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/arm64/aplsmc.4">aplsmc(4)</a>.
  <li>Changed the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mfii.4">mfii(4)</a>
	RAID controller driver to allow the firmware more time to transition
	out of the UNDEFINED state.
  <li>Added Wacom One S (CTL-472) support to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/uwacom.4">uwacom(4)</a>.
  </ul>

<li>New or improved network hardware support:
  <ul>
  <li>Increased rx buffer size on <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/uaq.4">uaq(4)</a> to 62kB.
  <li>Repaired <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rge.4">rge(4)</a>

  <li>Fixed a panic triggered by ifconfig bnxt0 down by changing <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bnxt.4">bnxt(4)</a> devices to not run
	rx and tx interrupt handlers when the interface is not running.
  <li>Introduced Large Receive Offloading of TCP segment offloading in  
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ix.4">ix(4)</a>. Also added a tso
	option to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>
	to enable and disable this feature.
  </ul>

<li>Added or improved wireless network drivers:
  <ul>
  <li>Made device matching in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwx.4">iwx(4)</a> more similar to Linux
	iwlwifi in order to recognize more devices.
  <li>Added support for AX210/AX211 devices to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwx.4">iwx(4)</a>.

  </ul>

<li>IEEE 802.11 wireless stack improvements and bugfixes:
  <ul>
  <li>Make sure drivers initialize all of ieee80211_rxinfo struct.
  </ul>

<li>Installer, upgrade and bootloader improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed the watchdog in the installer so that the watchdog is reset 
	after each download and each set installation.
  <li>Ensured that when running <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> on
	-stable that it will move to the next release, not -current.
  <li>Added the -b option to <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> to set
	an alternative base directory to which the installation files will be
	downloaded to.
  <li>Increased the <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a> auto
	partitioner's maximum size for /usr to 30G.
  <li>Altered installer behavior so the <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vlan.4">vlan(4)</a> question won't be
	asked unless another network interface exists.
  <li>Added support for wildcards in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> patterns.
  <!-- bootblock stuff -->
  <li>Added support for booting from RAID 1C <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a> volumes on
	amd64, sparc64 and arm64.
  <li>Added NFS client support to the luna88k RAMDISK kernel.

  <li>Switched bootloaders to the extended BOOTARG_CONSDEV struct.
  <li>Added UFS2 support to landisk boot blocks.
  </ul>

<li>Security improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Implemented privilege separation in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/xlock.1">xlock(1)</a>.
  <li>Added privilege separation to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpd(8)</a>.
  <li>The TZ environment variable no longer supports absolute paths,
	to fit better into the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a> bypass model.
  <li>AF_UNIX socket <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bind.2">bind(2)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/connect.2">connect(2)</a> now follow <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil(2)</a> configuration.
  <li>New <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypconnect.2">ypconnect(2)</a> system
	call creates a socket based upon the IP address encoded directly in a
	locked ypbinding file, thereby removing a horrible hack to support YP
	lookups in programs using strong
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a> rules.
  <li>Processes that pledge("vminfo") may now use the read-only <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/swapctl.2">swapctl(2)</a> operations
	SWAP_NSWAP and SWAP_STATS providing information on swap devices.
  <li>Randomized the rekey interval of <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/arc4random.3">arc4random(3)</a>.
  <li>Reduce the attack surface by introducing a 'local bind' mode to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypldap.8">ypldap(8)</a>. In this mode
	ypldap binds its RPC sockets to loopback, so YP services are only
	available to the host it's running on. ypldap writes the YP binding
	file in /var/yp/binding itself and replaces <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypbind.8">ypbind(8)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypserv.8">ypserv(8)</a>.  This also
	implies that <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/portmap.8">portmap(8)</a> doesn't need
	to be running anymore when local bind mode is used.
  <li>Changed the /sbin daemons <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpleased.8">dhcpleased(8)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mountd.8">mountd(8)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/nfsd.8">nfsd(8)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pflogd.8">pflogd(8)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolvd.8">resolvd(8)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/slaacd.8">slaacd(8)</a>, and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.8">unwind(8)</a> to be
	dynamically linked to allow them to benefit from all the additional
	mitigations that dynamically linked executables gain. NFS mounting of
	/usr must now use statically configured IP addresses.
  </ul>

<li>Changes in the network stack:
  <ul>
  <li>Added the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/recvmmsg.2">recvmmsg(2)</a> system call
	that allows receiving multiple msghdrs at once, and the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sendmmsg.2">sendmmsg</a> syscall that
	allows sending multiple msghdrs at once.
  <li>Relaxed address availability check for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/multicast.4">multicast(4)</a> binds so
	processes listening for the same multicast address do not need to be
	the same UID.
  <li>Introduced dedicated link entries for snapshots to <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfsync.4">pfsync(4)</a>.
  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> handling 
	of IGMP and ICMP6 MLD packets to allow multicast control packets to
	work by default.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> more paranoid about
      IGMP/MLD messages.
  <li>Fixed a logic bug in pf_find_state() that could cause <a 
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> to incorrectly block a
        packet.
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> syncookies during fast TCP port reuse.
  <li>Fixed a bug in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> 
	where a pool defined like "172.16.0.0/16" would count as a pool size                                            
	of one address. Also fixed random selection of source address to be
	uniform across the whole pool.
  <li>Fixed a kernel panic in <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> if IP options with an
	ICMP payload were truncated. Such packets will now be dropped instead.
  <li>Allow forwarding to and from IPs in the 240/4 range.
  <li>Corrected the Virtual Ethernet Bridge <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/veb.4">veb(4)</a> to avoid calling
	if_enqueue from an smr critical section.
  <li>Reworked the kroute rttimer code to fix icmp_pmtu_timeout crashes.
  <li>Fixed an interrupt storm upon suspend on Amlogic arm64 boards.
  <li>Fixed a race between pflow_output_process() and 
	pflow_clone_destroy() in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pflow.4">pflow(4)</a>.
   <li>Added a missing input validation step to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pipex.4">pipex(4)</a> MPPE keylenbits.
 </ul>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>IPsec support was improved:
  <ul>
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> ignore 
		any CERT payload after the first rather than failing the exchange when
		more than one CERT payload is received.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> support 
		for sending certificate chains with intermediate CAs in multiple CERT
		payloads.
	<li>Added an OpenIKED Vendor ID payload in the <a 
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> initial handshake to
		make it easier to handle interoperability problems with older versions
		in the future.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> 
		connection statistics for successful and failed connections, error
		types, and other events that can be printed with "ikectl show stats".
  </ul>
  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>Implement max-communities filter to limit the number of allowed
		communities, ext-communities and large-communities.
	<li>Fix insertion of additional non-transitive extended communities when
		sending out prefixes.
	<li>Relax IP address limitation by allowing prefixes in 240/4.
	<li>Implement RFC 9234 - Route Leak Prevention and Detection Using Roles
		in UPDATE and OPEN Messages.
	<li>Full support for RFC 7911 - Advertisement of Multiple Paths in BGP (ADD-PATH).
	<li>Improve FIB code, handle IPv6 scoped addresses properly.
	<li>Add <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgplgd.8">bgplgd(8)</a>,
	    a FastCGI server providing a REST API to execute
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpctl.8">bgpctl(8)</a> commands.
	<li>Bugfix: <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a> could
	    fail to invalidate nexthops and incorrectly leave them in the FIB or
	    Adj-RIB-Out. 
	<li>Speedup <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpctl.8">bgpctl</a>
		<code>show rib 10/8 or-longer</code> and <code>show rib 10/8
		or-shorter</code>
	<li>Switch various static hash tables to RB trees improving
		performance on large systems
	<li>Export per neighbor pending update and withdraw statistics
	<li>Fix race between a neighbor session reset and its update message
		backlog
	<li>Improve handling of nexthop reachability state changes
	<li>Made sure only one <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a> roa softreconfig
		runner is run at any time.
  </ul>
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> saw some changes:
  <ul>
	<li>Allowed more than one CRL URI in certificates.
	<li>Do not apply timezone offsets when converting X509 times.  X509
		times are in UTC and comparing them to times in different timezones
		would cause validity problems.
	<li>Add support for an operator-configurable skiplist facility.
		Operators can specify a list of FQDNs which should not be contacted
		when synchronizing the local cache to the network.
	<li>Emit a warning when a RRDP session serial number decreases.
	<li>DER decoding functions were refactored to leverage ASN.1 templates.
	<li>Add support to validate & inspect .sig files containing RPKI Signed
		Checklists in filemode (-f). (draft-ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc-08)
	<li>Print various statistics after the completion of the main process.
	<li>Add support to decode & print TAL (RFC 8630) details in filemode (-f).
	<li>Emit objects in Concatenated JSON format when filemode (-f) and the JSON
		output flag (-j) are combined.
	<li>Add support for validating Autonomous System Provider Authorization
		(ASPA) objects conforming to draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile-10.
		Validated ASPA payloads are visible in JSON and filemode (-f) output.
	<li>Set <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync.1">rsync(1)</a> connection I/O idle timeout to 15 seconds.
	<li>Unify the maximum idle I/O and connect timeouts for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync.1">rsync(1)</a> & HTTPS.
	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> now performs stricter EE certificate validation:
	<ul>
		<li>Disallow AS Resources extensions in ROA EE certificates.
		<li>Disallow Subject Information Access (SIA) extensions in RPKI
			Signed Checklist (RSC) EE certs.
		<li>Check the resources in ROAs and RSCs against EE certs.
	</ul>
	<li>Improve readability and add various information being printed in
		verbose mode.
	<li>Extend filemode (-f) output and print X.509 certificates in PEM
		format when increased verbosity (-vv) is specified.
	<li>Shorten the RRDP I/O idle timeout.
	<li>Introduce a deadline timer that aborts all repository synchronization 
		after seven eights of timeout (-s). With this rpki-client has improved
		chances to complete and produce an output even when a CA is excessively
		slow.
	<li>Abort a currently running RRDP request process when the per-repository
		timeout is reached.
	<li>Permit multiple AccessDescription entries in SIA X.509 extensions. While
		fetching from secondary locations is not yet supported, rpki-client will
		not treat occurrence as a fatal error.
	<li>Resolve a potential for a race condition in non-atomic RRDP deltas.
	<li>Fix some memory leaks.
	<li>Improve compliance with the HTTP protocol specification.
  </ul>

  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>Allow object names to be used in addition to OIDs in
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.conf.5">snmpd.conf(5)</a>.
	<li>Better type hinting for debug logging.
	<li>Introduce a blocklist feature, which removes subtrees from view.
	<li>Reintroduce AgentX master support.
	<li>Move non-SNMP related metrics to their own AgentX based backend.
	<li>The snmpe process is now pledged <code>stdio recvfd inet unix</code>.
	<li>Imported <a 
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd_metrics.8">snmpd_metrics(8)</a>.
		This allows those who need to use net-snmpd the ability to access base
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpd(8)</a> metrics.
  </ul>

  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ldapd.8">ldapd(8)</a>,
	match password schemas case sensitive.
  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ospfd.8">ospfd(8)</a>,
	relax the limitations on what is an acceptable unicast IP. There are no
	more experiments in IPv4 and so there is less reason for network
	daemons to deny formerly experimental IP space.  Multicast IPs
	(224/4) and loopback (127/8) are still disallowed.
  <li>Added check to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a> to
	ensure the challenge token is turned into a filename that is base64url
	encoded.
  <li>Added RFC 9234 "BGP Role" support to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump.8">tcpdump(8)</a>
  <li>Have <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump.8">tcpdump(8)</a> print
	ASnumbers in 'asplain' format instead of the old 'asdot' format.
  <li>Fixed a crash in libpcap when it would walk off the end of the array performing frees.
  <li>Made -X connect SOCKS work with IPv6 addresses in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a>.
  <li>Introduced a blocklist backend and keyword to <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpd(8)</a>, this deprecates
	filter-pf-addresses.
  <li>Changed <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a> to defer to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpleased.8">dhcpleased(8)</a> by
	doing execve ifconfig and providing syslog warnings about deprecated
	options.
  <li>Implemented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dig.1">dig(1)</a>
	support for SVCB and HTTPS record types.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolvd.8">resolvd(8)</a> 
	write /etc/resolv.conf in a more atomic manner.
  <li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/slowcgi.8">slowcgi(8)</a>
	-t flag to change the request timeout.
  <li>Corrected handling of an abnormal FastCGI termination in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>.
  <li>Made newer MIME type definitions take precedence over existing 
	ones in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>.
  <li>Moved the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a> 
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/daemon.3">daemon(3)</a> call to just
	before forking the children so the parent disassociates from its
	controlling terminal and shell, but not from its children.
  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ftp.1">ftp(1)</a> to use 
	non-blocking <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/connect.2">connect(2)</a> with <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ppoll.2">ppoll(2)</a> and timeout
	instead of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/alarm.3">alarm(3)</a>.
	This allows failing over to another IP address for hosts that have
	more than one.
  </ul>

<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> improvements and bug fixes:
  <ul>
  <li>Added an ACL list for multiple users attaching to the <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> socket.
  <li>Ensured cursor remains on selected item on menu in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>
	support for OSC 8 hyperlinks.

	mouse_hyperlink format to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>.
  <li>Added an "all" state to <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> allow-passthrough to
	work even in invisible panes.
  <li>Fixed a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> crash 
	when searching for .* with extremely long lines.

    <ul>
    <li>The ASN.1 time parser has been refactored and rewritten using CBS.
	It has been made stricter in that it now enforces the rules from
	RFC 5280.
    <li>ASN1_AFLG_BROKEN was removed.
    <li>Error check tls_session_secret_cb() like OpenSSL.
    <li>Added ASN1_INTEGER_{get,set}_{u,}int64()
    <li>Move leaf certificate checks to the last thing after chain
	validation.

	that only shows the ciphers supported by the specified protocol.
    <li>Use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/TLS_client_method.3">TLS_client_method(3)</a>
	instead of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/TLSv1_client_method.3">TLSv1_client_method(3)</a> in
	the <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1">openssl(1)</a> ciphers command.
    <li>Validate the protocols in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos.3">SSL{_CTX,}_set_alpn_protos()</a>.

    <li>Per RFC 7292, safeContentsBag is a SEQUENCE OF, not a SET OF.
    <li>Align PKCS12_key_gen_uni() with OpenSSL

        href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_check_ca.3">X509_check_ca()</a>.
	No return value of X509_check_ca() indicates failure. Application
	code should therefore issue a checked call to X509_check_purpose()

        href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a>'s HTTP CONNECT proxy.
    <li>Do not reject primes in trial divisions.

    <li>Fix the legacy verifier callback behaviour for untrusted certs.
    <li>Correct serfver-side handling of TLSv1.3 key updates.
    <li>Plug leak in PKCS12_setup_mac().
    <li>Plug leak in <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509V3_add1_i2d.3">X509V3_add1_i2d()</a>.
    <li>Only print X.509 versions we know about.
    <li>Avoid signed integer overflow due to unary negation

        href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_REQ_print_ex.3">X509_REQ_print_ex()</a>.
    <li>Check <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/HMAC.3">HMAC()</a> return value to avoid a later use of uninitialized.
    <li>Avoid potential NULL dereference in ssl_set_pkey().
    <li>Check return values in ssl_print_tmp_key().
    <li>Switch loop bounds from size_t to int in check_hosts().
    <li>Avoid division by zero if no connection was made in s_time.c.
    <li>Check sk_SSL_CIPHER_push() return value
    <li>Avoid out-of-bounds read in ssl_cipher_process_rulestr().
    <li>Use LONG_MAX as the limit for ciphers with long based APIs.
    </ul>

  <li>Internal improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Avoid expensive RFC 3779 checks during cert verification.
    <li>The templated ASN.1 decoder has been cleaned up, refactored,
	modernized with parts rewritten using CBB and CBS.
    <li>The ASN.1 time parser has been rewritten.
    <li>Rewrite and fix <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_STRING_to_UTF8.3">ASN1_STRING_to_UTF8()</a>.
    <li>Use asn1_abs_set_unused_bits() rather than inlining it.

    </ul>
  </ul>

<li>OpenSSH 9.1
  <ul>
  <li>Security
    <ul>
    <li>ssh-keyscan(1): fix a one-byte overflow in SSH- banner processing
    <li>ssh-keygen(1): fix double free() in error path of signing/verify code
    <li>ssh-keysign(8): fix double-free in error path introduced in OpenSSH 8.9.
    </ul>
  <li>Potentially-incompatible changes
    <ul>
    <li>ssh(1), sshd(8): SetEnv directives in ssh_config and sshd_config
      are now first-match-wins to match other directives. Previously
      if an environment variable was multiply specified the last set
      value would have been used.
    <li>ssh-keygen(8): ssh-keygen -A (generate all default host key types)
      will no longer generate DSA keys, as these are insecure and have
      not been used by default for some years.
    <li>ssh(1), sshd(8): add a RequiredRSASize directive to set a minimum
      RSA key length. Keys below this length will be ignored for user
      authentication and for host authentication in sshd(8).<br>
      ssh(1) will terminate a connection if the server offers an RSA key
      that falls below this limit, as the SSH protocol does not include
      the ability to retry a failed key exchange
    <li>sftp-server(8): add a <code>users-groups-by-id@openssh.com</code>
      extension request that allows the client to obtain user/group names that
      correspond to a set of uids/gids.
    <li>sftp(1): use <code>users-groups-by-id@openssh.com</code> sftp-server
      extension (when available) to fill in user/group names for
      directory listings.
    <li>sftp-server(8): support the <code>home-directory</code> extension
      request defined in draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-extensions-00. This overlaps
      a bit with the existing "expand-path@openssh.com", but some other
      clients support it.
    <li>ssh-keygen(1), sshd(8): allow certificate validity intervals,
      sshsig verification times and authorized_keys expiry-time options
      to accept dates in the UTC time zone in addition to the default
      of interpreting them in the system time zone. YYYYMMDD and
      YYMMDDHHMM[SS] dates/times will be interpreted as UTC if suffixed
      with a 'Z' character.<br>
      Also allow certificate validity intervals to be specified in raw
      seconds-since-epoch as hex value, e.g. -V 0x1234:0x4567890. This
      is intended for use by regress tests and other tools that call
      ssh-keygen as part of a CA workflow.
    <li>sftp(1): allow arguments to the sftp -D option, e.g. sftp -D
      <code>/usr/libexec/sftp-server -el debug3</code>.
    <li>ssh-keygen(1): allow the existing -U (use agent) flag to work
      with <code>-Y sign</code> operations, where it will be interpreted to
      require that the private keys is hosted in an agent.
    </ul>
  <li>Bugfixes
    <ul>
    <li>ssh-keygen(1): implement the "verify-required" certificate option.
      This was already documented when support for user-verified FIDO
      keys was added, but the ssh-keygen(1) code was missing.
    <li>ssh-agent(1): hook up the restrict_websafe command-line flag;
      previously the flag was accepted but never actually used.
    <li>sftp(1): improve filename tab completions: never try to complete
      names to non-existent commands, and better match the completion
      type (local or remote filename) against the argument position
      being completed.
    <li>ssh-keygen(1), ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): several fixes to FIDO key
      handling, especially relating to keys that request
      user-verification. These should reduce the number of unnecessary
      PIN prompts for keys that support intrinsic user verification.
    <li>ssh-keygen(1): when enrolling a FIDO resident key, check if a
      credential with matching application and user ID strings already
      exists and, if so, prompt the user for confirmation before
      overwriting the credential.
    <li> sshd(8): improve logging of errors when opening authorized_keys
      files.
    <li>ssh(1): avoid multiplexing operations that could cause SIGPIPE from
      causing the client to exit early. bz3454
    <li>ssh_config(5), sshd_config(5): clarify that the RekeyLimit
      directive applies to both transmitted and received data.
    <li>ssh-keygen(1): avoid double fclose() in error path.
    <li>sshd(8): log an error if pipe() fails while accepting a connection.
    <li>ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): fix possible NULL deref when built without
      FIDO support.
    <li>ssh-keyscan(1): add missing *-sk types to ssh-keyscan manpage.
    <li>sshd(8): ensure that authentication passwords are cleared from
      memory in error paths.
    <li>ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): avoid possibility of notifier code executing
      kill(-1).
    <li>ssh_config(5): note that the ProxyJump directive also accepts the
      same tokens as ProxyCommand.
    <li>scp(1): do not not ftruncate(3) files early when in sftp mode. The
      previous behaviour of unconditionally truncating the destination
      file would cause <code>scp ~/foo localhost:</code> and <code>scp
      localhost:foo ~/</code> to delete all the contents of their destination.
    <li>ssh-keygen(1): improve error message when <code>ssh-keygen -Y sign
      </code> is unable to load a private key.
    <li>sftp(1), scp(1): when performing operations that glob(3) a remote
      path, ensure that the implicit working directory used to construct
      that path escapes glob(3) characters. This prevents glob characters
      from being processed in places they shouldn't, e.g. <code>cd
      /tmp/a*/</code>, <code>get *.txt</code> should have the get operation
      treat the path <code>/tmp/a*</code> literally and not attempt to expand
      it.
    <li>ssh(1), sshd(8): be stricter in which characters will be accepted
      in specifying a mask length; allow only 0-9.
    <li>ssh-keygen(1): avoid printing hash algorithm twice when dumping a
      KRL.
    <li>ssh(1), sshd(8): continue running local I/O for open channels
      during SSH transport rekeying. This should make ~-escapes work in
      the client (e.g. to exit) if the connection happened to have
      stalled during a rekey event.
    <li>ssh(1), sshd(8): avoid potential poll() spin during rekeying
    <li>Further hardening for sshbuf internals: disallow "reparenting" a
      hierarchical sshbuf and zero the entire buffer if reallocation
      fails.
    </ul>
  </ul>

<li>mandoc 1.14.6 plus some new features and many bugfixes, including:
  <ul>
  <li>Significantly improved accessibility of
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.1">mandoc(1)</a>
	<code>-T html</code> and
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.cgi.8">man.cgi(8)</a>
	output by using semantically better HTML elements in several places
	and by adding ARIA and DPUB-ARIA roles and aria-label attributes
	to several HTML elements.
  <li>Got rid of archaic HTML table markup for header and footer lines
	in favor of flexbox CSS.
	Rendering now adapts to browser windows of arbitrary narrowness.
  <li>Prevented <code>-T html</code> output from turning breakable
	hyphens into underscores in URI fragment identifiers.
  <li>Improved the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/roff.7">roff(7)</a>
	escape sequence parser in several fundamental ways
	regarding output correctness and groff compatibility.
  <li>Corrected output that depends on the order of evaluation of
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/roff.7">roff(7)</a>
	escape sequences by parsing them left-to-right
	rather than right-to-left.
  <li>Significantly improved <code>-T lint</code> diagnostics regarding
	syntax errors in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/roff.7">roff(7)</a>
	escape sequences and in their arguments.
  <li>Stopped emitting vertical space before the
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tbl.7">tbl(7)</a> .TS (table
	start) macro for compatibility with the same change in groff.
	This implies .PP or .Pp macros may need to be inserted before .TS
	in some (but not all!) places in some manual pages using tbl(7).
  <li>Stopped skipping vertical space after the
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tbl.7">tbl(7)</a> .TE (table
	end) macro of boxed tables for compatibility with the same
	change in groff. This implies .sp requests may need to be
	removed after .TE in some manual pages using tbl(7).
  <li>Corrected the calculation of the width of spanned
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tbl.7">tbl(7)</a> columns.
  <li>Improved the handling of literal tab characters in filled text
	in multiple ways for compatibility with groff and Heirloom troff.
  <li>Plus bugfixes for two segfaults, two infinite loops, and several
	assertion failures.

<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the use of
the "<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel</a> -E" command.
If you are at all confused when installing OpenBSD, read the relevant
INSTALL.* file as listed above!

<h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install72.iso</i> or
<i>cd72.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install72.iso</i> or
<i>cd72.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install72.img</i> or
<i>miniroot72.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/arm64:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>install72.img</i> or <i>miniroot72.img</i> to a disk and boot from it
after connecting to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.arm64 for more
details.

<h3>OpenBSD/armv7:</h3>

<p>
Write a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install72.iso</i> or
<i>cd72.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install72.img</i> or
<i>miniroot72.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot72.img</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot72.img</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.2/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install72.img</i> or <i>miniroot72.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install72.img</i> or <i>miniroot72.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy72.img</i> or <i>floppyB72.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot72.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.1 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade72.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=sourcecode>
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=ports>
<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_2</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.2 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
