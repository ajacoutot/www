  <!-- XXX maybe remove again? -->
  <li>Fixed frame buffer corruption and additional bugs after wakeup
	on Apple Silicon laptops and the Lenovo x13s.
  </ul>

	<li>Provided a detailed e820 memory map when booting <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> guests with SeaBIOS.
		When a vm initializes memory ranges, we now track what each range
		represents. This information can be used to supply the e820 memory map
		to SeaBIOS via the fw_cfg interface allowing it to properly
		communicate memory ranges to a guest operating system. With this
		special cases in ports can be removed.

	<li>Added thread names to vm processes in <a

		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> guests, preventing
		invalid instruction exceptions. Also added WAITPKG feature
		identification to i386 and amd64.

	<li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> to
		only open /dev/vmm once, having the parent process send the fd to the
		vmm child process.

	<li>Adjusted <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> error paths to avoid removal of configuration-defined (known) VMs on error.
	<li>Stopped being paranoid about hypervisor correct PKU handling.<br>
	    Added saving and restoring guest PKRU to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>. Expose the PKU cpuid
		bit to the guest if in use on the host.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> scan the pci bus to determine bootorder strings.
  </ul>

	libraries in parallel to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstart.8">netstart(8)</a>, as this
	does not depend on network access.

  <li>Implemented periodic display in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iostat.8">iostat(8)</a>.

  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/df.1">df(1)</a> to
	round up fractional percentages.

	display variables periodically.
  <li>Added short options for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/timeout.1">timeout(1)</a> --foreground
	and --preserve-status.<br>
	Added signal as a full argument name for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/timeout.1">timeout(1)</a> -s.

  <li>Fixed .wav files generated by <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/aucat.1">aucat(1)</a> by using extended
	header format.
  <li>In <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a>, use the

  <li>Extended <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a> template
	parsing to allow "[mount point] *" as the specification for putting
	the maximum available free space into a partition, and extended
	command line parsing to allow "T-" as the specification to read the
	template from stdin.
  <li>Fixed a number of out of bounds reads in DNS response parsing.

  <li>Made efiboot fdt support device trees with NOPs in them (like the kernel version).
  <li>Improved the default choice for the installer's install media
	disk question to show the first disk (a) not the root disk and (b) not
	a disk with softraid chunks (hosting the root disk, for example).
  <li>Stopped offering WEP in the installer if not supported.
  <li>Added initial support in the installer for guided disk
	encryption for amd64, i386, riscv64 and sparc64.

  <!-- architecture specific -->
  <li>Switched luna88k boot loader to MI boot code.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ls.1">ls(1)</a> work
	correctly in the luna88k bootloader.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/time.1">time(1)</a> work
	correctly in the luna88k bootloader.
  <li>Removed dangerous user-settable "addr" variable from MI
	bootloader, only compiling tty-related code on platforms where it
	makes sense for the bootloader to control it.
  <li>Added "machine poweroff" command on luna88k bootloader.
  <li>Switched alpha to machine-independent boot blocks.
  <li>Switched loongson ramdisk to use <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a> -p.

  </ul>

<li>Security improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Add Synthetic Memory Protections. These provide
  <ul>
	<li>Immutable memory mappings whose permissions and size cannot be
		changed anymore. A new system call <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/mimmutable.2">mimmutable(2)</a> enables
		this feature. 
	<li>Execute-Only permission on memory mappings. This uses hardware
		support where possible and emulation where the hardware does not have
		seperate execute only features.
	<li>Stack permission on mappings: On every system call the stack
		pointer is checked. It must point to a mapping that has MAP_STACK
		permissions.
	<li>Pinning of syscall entry to a unique specific memory regions from
		which system calls can be made.
  </ul><br>
  The execute-only mappings are active on arm64, risc-v, hppa,
	aarch64, mips64, sparc64, amd64, mips, and power-pc platforms.

  <li>Implemented a --executable-only option in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.bfd.1">ld.bfd(1)</a>.

  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2">execve(2)</a>
	violations of <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscall.2">pinsyscall(2)</a> policy
	to the daily mail, available by setting rc.conf.local(5)
	accounting=YES.
  <li>Added retguard to amd64 syscalls.

  <li>Randomly relink and install <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> on boot, resulting
	in a sshd with unknown address layout after every reboot.

  <li>Add another mitigation against classic BROP on systems without
	execute-only mmu hardware-enforcement. A range-checking wrapper in
	front of copyin() and copyinstr() ensures the userland source address
	doesn't overlap the main program text and other text segments, thereby
	making this address ranges unreadable to the kernel. No programs have
	been discovered which require reading their own text segments with a
	system call.
  </ul>

<li>Changes in the network stack:
  <ul>

	<li>Used stoeplitz (symmetric Toeplitz hash algorithm) to generate a
		hash/flowid for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> state
		keys.  With this change, pf will hash traffic the same way that
		hardware using a stoeplitz key will hash incoming traffic on rings.
		stoeplitz is also used by the tcp stack to generate a flow id, which
		is used to pick which transmit ring is used on nics with multiple
		queues too. using the same algorithm throughout the stack encourages
		affinity of packets to rings and softnet threads the whole way
		through.

	<li>Prevented possible kernel crashes by dropping TCP packets with
		destination port 0 in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a>
		and the stack.

	<li>Fixed a endian swap bug causing problems with <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vlan.4">vlans(4)</a> on <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/em.4">em(4)</a> sparc64 systems.
	<li>Denied "pipex no" tunnel setting for <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pppx.4">pppx(4)</a> interfaces.
	<li>Fixed a panic in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfsync.4">pfsync(4)</a> when there are
		no data ready for bulk transfer.
	<li>Turned off TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) if interface is added
		to layer 2 devices.
  	<li>Improved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vnet.4">vnet(4)</a>
		to work better in busy conditions.
	<li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bpf.4">bpf(4)</a> timeout
		(BIOCSWTIMEOUT) between capturing a packet and making the buffer
		readable, preventing for example <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pflogd.8">pflogd(8)</a> waking every
		half second even if there is nothing to read. By default this buffer
		is infinite and must be filled to become readable.
	<li>Avoided enabling TSO on interfaces which are already attached to a bridge.

  </ul>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>IPsec support was improved:
  <ul>
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
		support for configuring multiple name servers.
	<li>Synced proc.c from <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> to enabled fork +
		exec for all processes. This gives each process a fresh and unique
		address space to further improve randomization of ASLR and stack
		protector.
  </ul>

  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpctl.8">bgpctl(8)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgplgd.8">bgplgd(8)</a>:
  <ul> 
    <li>Improved performance by optimising the output filters
    <li>Add Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) validaton
	based on draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification-12
    <li>Introduce avs (ASPA validation state) filter and bgpctl
	filter argument
   <li>Add ASPA support for the RTR protocol based on
	draft-ietf-sidrops-8210bis-10
   <li>Improve open policy (RFC 9234) support and enable the capability
	automatically if a role is specified for the peer
   <li>Introduce a per neighbor 'role' configuration option to specify
	the session role used by ASPA verification and the open policy
	capability. The 'announce policy' statement was simplified at
	the same time.
   <li>Improve startup behaviour by introducing a small delay before
	opening the connection to a new peer
   <li>Support for aspa-set table config which can be provided by
	<a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a>
   <li>Make it possible to filter the RIB by invalid and leaked prefixes
	in bgpctl and bgplgd
   <li>Add OpenMetrics output to bgpctl for various BGP statistics and
	add /metrics endpoint to bgplgd
   <li>Fix of incorrect length checks that allowed an out-of-bounds
	read in bgpd.
  </ul>
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> saw some changes:
  <ul>
    <li>Add a new '-H' command line option to create a shortlist of
	repositories to synchronize to. For example, when invoking
	"rpki-client -H rpki.ripe.net -H chloe.sobornost.net", the utility
	will not connect to any other hosts other than the two specified
	through the -H option.
    <li>Add support for validating Geofeed (RFC 9092) authenticators.  To
	see an example download https://sobornost.net/geofeed.csv and run
	"rpki-client -f geofeed.csv"
    <li>Add support for validating Trust Anchor Key (TAK) objects. TAK
	objects can be used to produce new Trust Anchor Locators (TALs) signed
	by and verified against the previous Trust Anchor. See
	draft-ietf-sidrops-signed-tal for the full specification.
    <li>Log lines related to RRDP/HTTPS connection problems now include the
	IP address of the problematic endpoint (in brackets).
    <li>Improve the error message when an invalid filename is encountered
	in the rpkiManifest field in the Subject Access Information (SIA)
	extension.
    <li>Emit a warning when unexpected X.509 extensions are encountered.
    <li>Restrict the ROA ipAddrBlocks field to only allow two
	ROAIPAddressFamily structures (one per address family).	See
	draft-ietf-sidrops-rfc6482bis.
    <li>Check the absence of the Path Length constraint in the Basic
	Constraints extension.
    <li>Restrict the SIA extension to only allow the signedObject and
	rpkiNotify accessMethods.
    <li>Check that the Signed Object access method is present in ROA, MFT,
	ASPA, TAK, and GBR End-Entity certificates.
    <li>In addition to the 'rsync://' scheme, also permit other schemes
	(such as 'https://') in the SIA signedObject access method.
    <li>Check that the KeyUsage extension is set to nothing but
	digitalSignature on End-Entity certificates.
    <li>Chect that the KeyUsage extension is set to nothing but keyCertSign
	and CRLSign on CA certificates.
    <li>Check that the ExtendedKeyUsage extension is absent on CA
	certificates.
    <li>Fix a bug in the handling of the port of http_proxy.
    <li>The '-r' command line option has been deprecated.
    <li>Filemode (-f) output is now presented as a text based table.
    <li>The 'expires' key in the JSON/CSV/OpenBGPD output formats is now
	calculated with more accuracy. The calculation takes into account the
	nextUpdate value of all intermediate CRLs in the signature path
	towards the trust anchor, in addition to the expiry moment of the
	leaf-CRL and CAs.
    <li>Handling of CRLs and Manifests in the face of inconsistent RRDP delta
	publications has been improved. A copy of an alternative version of
	the applicable CRL is kept in the staging area of the cache directory,
	in order to increase the potential for establishing a complete
	publication point, in cases where a single publication point update
	was smeared across multiple RRDP delta files.
    <li>The OpenBGPD configuration output now includes validated Autonomous
	System Provider Authorization (ASPA) payloads as an 'aspa-set {}'
	configuration block.
    <li>When rpki-client is invoked with increased verbosity ('-v'), the
	current RRDP Serial & Session ID are shown to aid debugging.
    <li>Self-signed X.509 certificates (such as Trust Anchor certificates)
	now are considered invalid if they contain an X.509
	AuthorityInfoAccess extension.
    <li>Signed Objects where the CMS signing-time attribute contains a
	timestamp later then the X.509 certificate's notAfter timestamp are
	considered invalid.
    <li>Manifests where the CMS signing-time attribute contains a timestamp
	later then the Manifest eContent nextUpdate timestamp are considered
	invalid.
    <li>Any objects whose CRL Distribution Points extension contains a
	CRLIssuer, CRL Reasons, or nameRelativeToCRLIssuer field are
	considered invalid in accordance with RFC 6487 section 4.8.6.
    <li>For every X.509 certificate the SHA-1 of the Subject Public Key is
	calculated and compared to the Subject Key Identifier (SKI), if a
	mismatch is found the certificate is not trusted.
    <li>Require the outside-TBS signature OID for every X.509 intermediate
	CA certificate and CRL to be sha256WithRSAEncryption.
    <li>Require the RSA key pair modulus and public exponent parameters to
	strictly conform to the RFC 7935 profile.
    <li>Ensure there is no trailing garbage present in Signed Objects beyond
	the self-embedded length field.
    <li>Require RRDP Session IDs to strictly be version 4 UUIDs.
    <li>When decoding and validating an individual RPKI file using filemode
	(rpki-client -f file), display the signature path towards the trust
	anchor, and the timestamp when the signature path will expire.
    <li>When decoding and validating an individual RPKI file using filemode
	(rpki-client -f file), display the optional CMS signing-time, and
  	non-optional X.509 notBefore, and X.509 notAfter timestamps.

    </ul>
  </ul>

<li>OpenSSH 9.3 and OpenSSH 9.2<br>
This release of OpenBSD includes the changes made to OpenSSH since release 9.1:
  <ul>
  <li>Security
    <ul>
    <li>ssh-add(1): when adding smartcard keys to ssh-agent(1) with the
      per-hop destination constraints (ssh-add -h ...) added in OpenSSH
      8.9, a logic error prevented the constraints from being
      communicated to the agent. This resulted in the keys being added
      without constraints. The common cases of non-smartcard keys and
      keys without destination constraints are unaffected. This problem
      was reported by Luci Stanescu.
    <li>ssh(1): Portable OpenSSH provides an implementation of the
      getrrsetbyname(3) function if the standard library does not
      provide it, for use by the VerifyHostKeyDNS feature. A
      specifically crafted DNS response could cause this function to
      perform an out-of-bounds read of adjacent stack data, but this
      condition does not appear to be exploitable beyond denial-of-
      service to the ssh(1) client.<br>
      The getrrsetbyname(3) replacement is only included if the system's
      standard library lacks this function and portable OpenSSH was not
      compiled with the ldns library (--with-ldns). getrrsetbyname(3) is
      only invoked if using VerifyHostKeyDNS to fetch SSHFP records. This
      problem was found by the Coverity static analyzer.
    <li>sshd(8): fix a pre-authentication double-free memory fault
      introduced in OpenSSH 9.1. This is not believed to be exploitable,
      and it occurs in the unprivileged pre-auth process that is
      subject to chroot(2) and is further sandboxed on most major
      platforms.
    <li>ssh(8): in OpenSSH releases after 8.7, the PermitRemoteOpen option
      would ignore its first argument unless it was one of the special
      keywords "any" or "none", causing the permission list to fail open
      if only one permission was specified. bz3515
    <li>ssh(1): if the CanonicalizeHostname and CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
      options were enabled, and the system/libc resolver did not check
      that names in DNS responses were valid, then use of these options
      could allow an attacker with control of DNS to include invalid
      characters (possibly including wildcards) in names added to
      known_hosts files when they were updated. These names would still
      have to match the CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs allow-list, so
      practical exploitation appears unlikely.
      </ul>
  <li>Potentially-incompatible changes
      <ul>
    <li>ssh(1): add a new EnableEscapeCommandline ssh_config(5) option that
      controls whether the client-side ~C escape sequence that provides a
      command-line is available. Among other things, the ~C command-line
      could be used to add additional port-forwards at runtime.<br>
      This option defaults to "no", disabling the ~C command-line that
      was previously enabled by default. Turning off the command-line
      allows platforms that support sandboxing of the ssh(1) client
      (currently only OpenBSD) to use a stricter default sandbox policy.
      </ul>
  <li>New features
      <ul>
    <li>ssh-keygen(1), ssh-keyscan(1): accept -Ohashalg=sha1|sha256 when
      outputting SSHFP fingerprints to allow algorithm selection. bz3493
    <li>sshd(8): add a `sshd -G` option that parses and prints the
      effective configuration without attempting to load private keys
      and perform other checks. This allows usage of the option before
      keys have been generated and for configuration evaluation and
      verification by unprivileged users.
    <li>sshd(8): add support for channel inactivity timeouts via a new
      sshd_config(5) ChannelTimeout directive. This allows channels that
      have not seen traffic in a configurable interval to be
      automatically closed. Different timeouts may be applied to session,
      X11, agent and TCP forwarding channels.
    <li>sshd(8): add a sshd_config UnusedConnectionTimeout option to
      terminate client connections that have no open channels for a
      length of time. This complements the ChannelTimeout option above.
    <li>sshd(8): add a -V (version) option to sshd like the ssh client has.
    <li>ssh(1): add a "Host" line to the output of ssh -G showing the
      original hostname argument. bz3343
    <li>scp(1), sftp(1): add a -X option to both scp(1) and sftp(1) to
      allow control over some SFTP protocol parameters: the copy buffer
      length and the number of in-flight requests, both of which are used
      during upload/download. Previously these could be controlled in
      sftp(1) only. This makes them available in both SFTP protocol
      clients using the same option character sequence.
    <li>ssh-keyscan(1): allow scanning of complete CIDR address ranges,
      e.g.  "ssh-keyscan 192.168.0.0/24". If a CIDR range is passed, then
      it will be expanded to all possible addresses in the range
      including the all-0s and all-1s addresses. bz#976
    <li>ssh(1): support dynamic remote port forwarding in escape
      command-line's -R processing. bz#3499
      </ul>
  <li>Bugfixes
      <ul>
    <li>scp(1), sftp(1): fix progressmeter corruption on wide displays;
      bz3534
    <li>ssh-add(1), ssh-keygen(1): use RSA/SHA256 when testing usability
      of private keys as some systems are starting to disable RSA/SHA1
      in libcrypto.
    <li>sftp-server(8): fix a memory leak. GHPR363
    <li>ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-keyscan(1): remove vestigal protocol
      compatibility code and simplify what's left.
    <li>Fix a number of low-impact Coverity static analysis findings.
      These include several reported via bz2687
    <li>ssh_config(5), sshd_config(5): mention that some options are not
      first-match-wins.
    <li>Rework logging for the regression tests. Regression tests will now
      capture separate logs for each ssh and sshd invocation in a test.
    <li>ssh(1): make `ssh -Q CASignatureAlgorithms` work as the manpage
      says it should; bz3532.
    <li>ssh(1): ensure that there is a terminating newline when adding a
      new entry to known_hosts; bz3529
    <li>ssh(1): when restoring non-blocking mode to stdio fds, restore
      exactly the flags that ssh started with and don't just clobber them
      with zero, as this could also remove the append flag from the set.
      bz3523
    <li>ssh(1): avoid printf("%s", NULL) if using UserKnownHostsFile=none
      and a hostkey in one of the system known hosts file changes.
    <li>scp(1): switch scp from using pipes to a socket-pair for
      communication with its ssh sub-processes, matching how sftp(1)
      operates.
    <li>sshd(8): clear signal mask early in main(); sshd may have been
      started with one or more signals masked (sigprocmask(2) is not
      cleared on fork/exec) and this could interfere with various things,
      e.g. the login grace timer. Execution environments that fail to
      clear the signal mask before running sshd are clearly broken, but
      apparently they do exist.
    <li>ssh(1): warn if no host keys for hostbased auth can be loaded.
    <li>sshd(8): Add server debugging for hostbased auth that is queued and
      sent to the client after successful authentication, but also logged
      to assist in diagnosis of HostbasedAuthentication problems. bz3507
    <li>ssh(1): document use of the IdentityFile option as being usable to
      list public keys as well as private keys. GHPR352
    <li>sshd(8): check for and disallow MaxStartups values less than or
      equal to zero during config parsing, rather than failing later at
      runtime.  bz3489
    <li>ssh-keygen(1): fix parsing of hex cert expiry times specified on
      the command-line when acting as a CA.
    <li>scp(1): when scp(1) is using the SFTP protocol for transport (the
      default), better match scp/rcp's handling of globs that don't match
      the globbed characters but do match literally (e.g. trying to
      transfer a file named "foo.[1]"). Previously scp(1) in SFTP mode
      would not match these pathnames but legacy scp/rcp mode would.
      bz3488
    <li>ssh-agent(1): document the "-O no-restrict-websafe" command-line
      option.
    <li>ssh(1): honour user's umask(2) if it is more restrictive then the
      ssh default (022).

<section id=quickinstall>
<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the use of
the "<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel</a> -E" command.
If you are at all confused when installing OpenBSD, read the relevant
INSTALL.* file as listed above!

<h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install73.iso</i> or
<i>cd73.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install73.iso</i> or
<i>cd73.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install73.img</i> or
<i>miniroot73.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/arm64:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>install73.img</i> or <i>miniroot73.img</i> to a disk and boot from it
after connecting to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.arm64 for more
details.

<h3>OpenBSD/armv7:</h3>

<p>
Write a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install73.iso</i> or
<i>cd73.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install73.img</i> or
<i>miniroot73.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot73.img</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot73.img</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.3/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install73.img</i> or <i>miniroot73.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install73.img</i> or <i>miniroot73.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy73.img</i> or <i>floppyB73.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot73.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.2 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade73.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=sourcecode>
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=ports>
<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_3</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.3 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
