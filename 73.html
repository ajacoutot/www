<h3>What's New</h3>
<p>
This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 7.3.
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="plus73.html">changelog</a> leading
to 7.3.

<ul>

<li>Various kernel improvements:
  <ul>


  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/waitid.2">waitid(2)</a>,
	wait for process state change.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscall.2">pinsyscall(2)</a>,
	specify the call stub for a specific system call.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getthrname.2">getthrname(2)</a> and
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/setthrname.2">setthrname(2)</a>,
	get or set thread name.
  <li>Added WTRAPPED option for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/waitid.2">waitid(2)</a> to control
	whether CLD_TRAPPED state changes, i.e., ptrace(2) on a process, are reported.

<!-- kernel internals -->
  <li>Introduced <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/clockintr.9">clockintr(9)</a>, a
	machine-independent clock interrupt scheduler. Switched all
	architectures to use the new subsystem.
  <li>Introduced a new kern.autoconf_serial <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.8">sysctl(8)</a> that can be used
	by userland to monitor state changes of the kernel device tree.
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pmap.9">pmap(9)</a> bugs
	involving entering an executable mapping for a page before
	synchronizing the data and instruction cache on arm64 and riscv64.
  <li>Removed copystr(9) from the public API.
  <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/getnsecruntime.9">getnsecruntime(9)</a>.
	Offers fast access to the system runtime clock at the cost of precision.

  <li>Prevent detaching ("bioctl -d detach") of a boot volume on a RAID managed by <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bioctl.8">bioctl(8)</a>.

  <li>On arm64, avoid using 1GB mappings for the identity map in the
	early kernel bootstrap phase and when booting the secondary CPUs. This
	avoids accidentally mapping memory regions that should not be mapped
	(i.e. secure memory) as all mapped memory can be accessed
	speculatively.
  <li>On arm64, add a machdep.lidaction <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.8">sysctl(8)</a> for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/aplsmc.4">aplsmc(4)</a> Apple Silicon
	laptops.<br>
  	The arm64 default for the machdep.lidaction is 1, making the
	system suspend when the lid is closed. <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/aplsmc.4">aplsmc(4)</a> provides support
	for the lid position sensor.
  <li>Changed arm64 suspend idle loop from WFE to WFI, avoiding spurious
	wakeups while other CPUs are still active.
  <li>Added new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dt.4">dt(4)</a> tracing ioctl
	DTIOCARGS to get the type of probe arguments.
  </ul>

<li>SMP Improvements
  <ul>
  <li>Unlocked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/munmap.2">munmap(2)</a>, and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mprotect.2">mprotect(2)</a>.
  <li>Unlocked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sched_yield.2">sched_yield(2)</a>.
  <li>Added support for per-CPU counters to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/evcount.9">evcount(9)</a>.
	Useful for counting events that are prone to occur simultaneously
	across multiple CPUs, like clock interrupts and IPIs.
  <li>Moved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> purge
	tasks out from under the kernel lock.
  <li>Unlocked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ioctl.2">ioctl(2)</a>
	SIOCGIFCONF, SIOCGIFGMEMB, SIOCGIFGATTR, and SIOCGIFGLIST.
  <li>Protected interface tables in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> with PF_LOCK(), allowing
	removal of NET_LOCK() protection from the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ioctl.2">ioctl(2)</a> code path in pf.
  <li>Unlocked <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/getsockopt.2">getsockopt(2)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/setsockopt.2">setsockopt(2)</a>.
  <li>Completed removing kernel lock from IPv6 read ioctls.
  <li>Unlocked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/minherit.2">minherit(2)</a>.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tun.4">tun(4)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/tap.4">tap(4)</a> event filters MP-safe.
  <li>Unlocked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/utrace.2">utrace(2)</a>.
  <li>Stopped holding the vm_map lock while flushing pages in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/msync.2">msync(2)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/madvise.2">madvise(2)</a>. Prevents a
	3-thread deadlock between <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/msync.2">msync(2)</a>, page-fault and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>.
  <li>Unlocked <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/select.2">select(2)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pselect.2">pselect(2)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/poll.2">poll(2)</a>, and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ppoll.2">ppoll(2)</a>.
  </ul>

<li>Direct Rendering Manager and graphics drivers
  <ul>
  <li>Updated <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/drm.4">drm(4)</a>
      to Linux 6.1.15
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/drm.4">amdgpu(4)</a>: Added
      support for Ryzen 7000 "Raphael", Ryzen 7020 series "Mendocino",
      Ryzen 7045 series "Dragon Range",
      Radeon RX 7900 XT/XTX "Navi 31",
      Radeon RX 7600M (XT), 7700S, and 7600S "Navi 33."
  <li>Fixed frame buffer corruption and additional bugs after wakeup
	on Apple Silicon laptops and the Lenovo x13s.
  <li>Added support for the backlight connector property to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/amdgpu.4">amdgpu(4)</a> as in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/inteldrm.4">inteldrm(4)</a>, making <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/xbacklight.1">xbacklight(1)</a> work
	when using the Xorg modesetting driver.
  </ul>

<li>VMM/VMD improvements
  <ul>
	<li>Updated <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> to
		permit SVM guests read access to MSR_HWCR and MSR_PSTATEDEF.
		Guests can use these registers on AMD 17h and 19h hosts to
		determine the TSC frequency without calibrating against a
		second clock.
	<li>Allocated reference for vm and vcpu SLISTs in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>, keeping vmm from
		triggering excessive wakeup calls while iterating through the list of
		vms while servicing an <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/ioctl.2">ioctl(2)</a>.
	<li>Set <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> RAX guest
		register state based on VMCB.
	<li>Removed locking in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> vmm_intr_pending,
		reducing slowdowns due to requests for a lock held while the VM is
		running.
	<li>Increased speed of delivery of interrupts to a running vcpu in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> treat vcpu
		lists as immutable, removing the need to reference count individual
		vcpu objects and use a rwlock.
	<li>Implemented zero-copy operations on virtqueues in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>.
	<li>Provided a detailed e820 memory map when booting <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> guests with SeaBIOS.
		When a vm initializes memory ranges, we now track what each range
		represents. This information can be used to supply the e820 memory map
		to SeaBIOS via the fw_cfg interface allowing it to properly
		communicate memory ranges to a guest operating system. With this
		special cases in ports can be removed.
	<li>Added thread names to vm processes in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>, visible in <a 
                href="https://man.openbsd.org/ps.1">ps(1)</a>.
	<li>Hid the WAITPKG cpu feature from <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> guests, preventing
		invalid instruction exceptions. Also added WAITPKG feature
		identification to i386 and amd64.
	<li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> to
		only open /dev/vmm once, having the parent process send the fd to the
		vmm child process.
	<li>Restricted <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>
		exposed cpuid extended feature flags.
	<li>Adjusted <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> error
		paths to avoid removal of configuration-defined (known) VMs on error.
	<li>Stopped being paranoid about hypervisor correct PKU handling.<br>
	    Added saving and restoring guest PKRU to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>. Expose the PKU cpuid
		bit to the guest if in use on the host.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> scan the
		PCI bus to determine bootorder strings.
  </ul>

<li>Various new userland features:
  <ul>
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kdump.1">kdump(1)</a>
	argument support for msyscall, pledge, unveil, __realpath, ypconnect
	and __tmpfd.
  <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mimmutable.2">mimmutable(2)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/munmap.2">munmap(2)</a> reporting to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/kdump.1">kdump(1)</a>.
  <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/lastcomm.1">lastcomm(1)</a> reporting
	for process kills due to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2">execve(2)</a> from non-pinned
	syscall address.
  </ul>

<li>Various bugfixes and tweaks in userland:
  <ul>
  <li>Allow TZ to contain absolute paths starting with /usr/share/zoneinfo.
	All absolute paths were ignored in 7.2 to avoid
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil(2)</a> violations.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ldomctl.8">ldomctl(8)</a>
	accept more descriptive name-based paths in addition to number-based
	paths in <a

  <li>Dropped support for $rc_exec in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.subr.8">rc.subr(8)</a>. The rc_exec
	function should be used instead.
  <li>Excluded /tmp/*.shm files from /tmp cleaning in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/daily.8">daily(8)</a>. Removing them
	interferes with programs that use shared memory via <a

	instead of statclock ticks.
  <li>Improved the periodic display in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iostat.8">iostat(8)</a>.
  <li>Fixed an edge case in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/top.1">top(1)</a>
	where summary statistics for offline CPUs were displayed.
  <li>Added support for a personal <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/units.1">units(1)</a> library by passing
	-f multiple times.
  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/df.1">df(1)</a> to
	round up fractional percentages.
  <li>Fixed unbounded variable expansion in <a

	architectures that use <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.lld.1">ld.lld(1)</a>.
<!-- rc scripts -->
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a> reorder
	libraries in parallel to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstart.8">netstart(8)</a>, as this
	does not depend on network access.

  </ul>

<li>IEEE 802.11 wireless stack improvements and bugfixes:
  <ul>
  <li>Made net80211 drop beacons received on secondary HT/VHT

	than the more limited <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sh.1">sh(1)</a>.
  <li>Added support for configuring interfaces by lladdr (MAC).
  <li>Made the installer skip interface configuration questions when no interfaces are available.
  <li>Fixed resizing partitions on an auto-allocated disk that had a boot partition.
  <li>Stopped the installer from asking to initialize disks that have
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a> chunks.
  <li>Made efiboot fdt support device trees with NOPs in them (like the kernel version).
  <li>Improved the default choice for the installer's install media
	disk question to show the first disk that (a) is not the root disk and (b)
	is not a disk with softraid chunks (hosting the root disk, for example).
  <li>Stopped offering WEP in the installer if not supported.
  <li>Fixed lock file error on installer exit/abort.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a> <code>-p</code>
	support <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a> silently skip
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a> keydisks.
  <li>Fixed passing explicit stages files to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a>.
<!-- architecture specific -->
  <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount_nfs.8">mount_nfs(8)</a> to the
	sparc64 installer, to fetch sets over NFS.
  <li>Copy the apple-boot firmware to EFI system partition, enabling
	automatic bootloader updates on Apple Silicon computers.
  <li>Made the installer stop printing MD post installation instructions on upgrades.

  <li>Added initial support in the installer for guided disk
	encryption for amd64, i386, riscv64 and sparc64.
  <li>Added passing of boot device information from the bootloader to
	the kernel on luna88k.
  <li>Switched luna88k boot loader to MI boot code.
  <li>Made the luna88k bootloader display a puffy boot logo.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ls.1">ls(1)</a> work
	correctly in the luna88k bootloader.

	correctly in the luna88k bootloader.
  <li>Removed dangerous user-settable "addr" variable from MI
	bootloader, only compiling tty-related code on platforms where it
	makes sense for the bootloader to control it.
  <li>Added "machine poweroff" command on luna88k bootloader.
  <li>Switched alpha to machine-independent boot blocks.
  <li>Switched all architectures' ramdisks (except alpha's and luna88k's) to use
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a> <code>-p</code>.

	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a> on riscv64.
  <li>Stopped creating defunct Vax (ra, rx), HP-300 (hd) and Sparc (xy, xd)
  devices in /dev.
  </ul>

<li>Security improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Permissions (RWX, MAP_STACK, etc.) on address space regions can
	be made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mimmutable.2">immutable</a>,
	so that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mprotect.2">mprotect(2)</a> or <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/munmap.2">munmap(2)</a> fail with EPERM.
	Most of the program static address space is now automatically
	immutable (main program, ld.so, main stack, load-time shared
	libraries, and dlopen()'d libraries mapped without RTLD_NODELETE).
	Programmers can request non-immutable static data using the
	"openbsd.mutable" section, or manually bring immutability to (page
	aligned heap objects) using <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mimmutable.2">mimmutable(2)</a>.
	The main internal data of <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>
	is marked immutable.
  <li>Some architectures now have non-readable code ("xonly"), both from
	the perspective of userland reading its own memory, or the kernel
	trying to read memory in a system call. Many sloppy practices in
	userland code had to be repaired to allow this. The linker
        (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.lld.1">ld.lld(1)</a> or
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.bfd.1">ld.bfd(1)</a>) option
	--execute-only is enabled by default. In order of development: arm64,
	riscv64, hppa, amd64, powerpc64, powerpc (G5 only), octeon, and sparc64
	(sun4u only; unfinished). 
  <li>These can still benefit from switching to --execute-only binaries if the
	cpu generates different traps for instruction-fetch versus data-fetch.
	The VM system will not allow memory to be read before it was executed
	which is valuable together with library relinking. Architectures
	switched over include loongson. 
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so.1">ld.so(1)</a> and crt0
	register the location of the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2">execve(2)</a> stub with the
	kernel using pinsyscall(2), after which the kernel only accepts an
	execve call from that specific location.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2">execve(2)</a>
	violations of <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscall.2">pinsyscall(2)</a> policy
	to the daily mail, available by setting rc.conf.local(5)
	accounting=YES.
  <li>Added retguard (consistency-check the return address on the
	stack) to amd64 syscalls.
  <li>sshd random relinking at boot: Randomly relink and install <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>, resulting
	in a sshd binary with unknown address layout after every reboot.
  <li>Add another mitigation against classic BROP on systems without
	execute-only mmu hardware-enforcement. A range-checking wrapper in
	front of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/copyin.9">copyin(9)</a> and
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/copyinstr.9">copyinstr(9)</a> ensures
	the userland source address doesn't overlap the main program text and
	other text segments, thereby making these address ranges unreadable to
	the kernel. No programs have been discovered which require reading
	their own text segments with a system call.
  <li>On arm64, introduce mitigation of the Spectre-BHB (Branch
	History Injection) CPU vulnerability by using core-specific trampoline
	vectors.
  <li>Enabled the arm64 Data Independent Timing (DIT) feature in both the kernel and
	userland on CPUs that support it to mitigate timing side-channel
	attacks.
  </ul>

<li>Changes in the network stack:
  <ul>
	<li>Made /dev/pf a clonable device to better track kernel resources
		used by processes.
	<li>Modified TCP receive buffer size auto-scaling to use the smoothed
		RTT (SRTT) instead of the timestamp option, which improves performance
		on high latency networks if the timestamp option isn't available.
	<li>Relaxed the requirement for multicast support of interfaces for
		configuring IPv6.  This allows non-multicast interfaces such as
		point-to-point interfaces and the NBMA / point-to-multipoint
		interfaces like mpe(4), mgre(4) and wg(4) to work with IPv6.
	<li>Measure the TCP_KEEPALIVE timeout with <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/getnsecruntime.9">getnsecruntime(9)</a>
		instead of the system uptime.
		Prevents TCP connections from needlessly failing en masse after
		waking a system from suspend.
	<li>Used stoeplitz (symmetric Toeplitz hash algorithm) to generate a
		hash/flowid for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> state
		keys.  With this change, pf will hash traffic the same way that
		hardware using a stoeplitz key will hash incoming traffic on rings.
		stoeplitz is also used by the TCP stack to generate a flow id, which
		is used to pick which transmit ring is used on nics with multiple
		queues, too. Using the same algorithm throughout the stack encourages
		affinity of packets to rings and softnet threads the whole way
		through.
	<li>Prevented possible kernel crashes by dropping TCP packets with
		destination port 0 in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a>
		and the stack.
	<li>Fixed an endian swap bug causing problems with <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vlan.4">vlan(4)</a> on <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/em.4">em(4)</a> sparc64 systems.
	<li>Denied "pipex no" tunnel setting for <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pppx.4">pppx(4)</a> interfaces.
	<li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfsync.4">pfsync(4)</a>
		crashing on pf_state_key removal.
	<li>Fixed a panic in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfsync.4">pfsync(4)</a> when there is
		no data ready for bulk transfer.
	<li>Turned off TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) if interface is added
		to layer 2 devices.
  	<li>Improved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vnet.4">vnet(4)</a>
		to work better in busy conditions.
	<li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bpf.4">bpf(4)</a> timeout
		(BIOCSWTIMEOUT) between capturing a packet and making the buffer
		readable, preventing, for example, <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pflogd.8">pflogd(8)</a> waking every
		half second even if there is nothing to read. By default this buffer
		is infinite and must be filled to become readable.
	<li>Avoided enabling TSO on interfaces which are already attached to a bridge.
  </ul>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>IPsec support was improved:
  <ul>
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
		support for configuring multiple name servers.
	<li>Synced proc.c from <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> to enable fork +
		exec for all processes. This gives each process a fresh and unique
		address space to further improve randomization of ASLR and stack
		protector.
  </ul>
  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpctl.8">bgpctl(8)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgplgd.8">bgplgd(8)</a>:
  <ul> 
    <li>Improved performance by optimising the output filters.
    <li>Add Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) validation
	based on draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification-12
    <li>Introduce avs (ASPA validation state) filter and bgpctl
	filter argument.
    <li>Add ASPA support for the RTR protocol based on
	draft-ietf-sidrops-8210bis-10.
    <li>Improve open policy (RFC 9234) support and enable the capability
	automatically if a role is specified for the peer.
    <li>Introduce a per-neighbor 'role' configuration option to specify
	the session role used by ASPA verification and the open policy
	capability. The 'announce policy' statement was simplified at
	the same time.
    <li>Improve startup behaviour by introducing a small delay before
	opening the connection to a new peer.
    <li>Support for aspa-set table config which can be provided by
	<a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a>.
    <li>Make it possible to filter the RIB by invalid and leaked prefixes
	in bgpctl and bgplgd.
    <li>Add OpenMetrics output to bgpctl for various BGP statistics and
	add /metrics endpoint to bgplgd.
    <li>Fix of incorrect length checks that allowed an out-of-bounds

  </ul>
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> saw some changes:
  <ul>
    <li>Add a new '-H' command line option to create a shortlist of
	repositories to synchronize to. For example, when invoking
	"rpki-client -H rpki.ripe.net -H chloe.sobornost.net", the utility
	will not connect to any other hosts other than the two specified
	through the -H option.
    <li>Add support for validating Geofeed (RFC 9092) authenticators.  To
	see an example download https://sobornost.net/geofeed.csv and run
	"rpki-client -f geofeed.csv"
    <li>Add support for validating Trust Anchor Key (TAK) objects. TAK
	objects can be used to produce new Trust Anchor Locators (TALs) signed
	by and verified against the previous Trust Anchor. See
	draft-ietf-sidrops-signed-tal for the full specification.
    <li>Log lines related to RRDP/HTTPS connection problems now include the
	IP address of the problematic endpoint (in brackets).
    <li>Improve the error message when an invalid filename is encountered
	in the rpkiManifest field in the Subject Access Information (SIA)
	extension.
    <li>Emit a warning when unexpected X.509 extensions are encountered.
    <li>Restrict the ROA ipAddrBlocks field to only allow two
	ROAIPAddressFamily structures (one per address family).	See
	draft-ietf-sidrops-rfc6482bis.
    <li>Check the absence of the Path Length constraint in the Basic
	Constraints extension.
    <li>Restrict the SIA extension to only allow the signedObject and
	rpkiNotify accessMethods.
    <li>Check that the Signed Object access method is present in ROA, MFT,
	ASPA, TAK, and GBR End-Entity certificates.
    <li>In addition to the 'rsync://' scheme, also permit other schemes
	(such as 'https://') in the SIA signedObject access method.
    <li>Check that the KeyUsage extension is set to nothing but
	digitalSignature on End-Entity certificates.
    <li>Check that the KeyUsage extension is set to nothing but keyCertSign
	and CRLSign on CA certificates.
    <li>Check that the ExtendedKeyUsage extension is absent on CA
	certificates.
    <li>Fix a bug in the handling of the port of http_proxy.
    <li>The '-r' command line option has been deprecated.
    <li>Filemode (-f) output is now presented as a text based table.
    <li>The 'expires' key in the JSON/CSV/OpenBGPD output formats is now
	calculated with more accuracy. The calculation takes into account the
	nextUpdate value of all intermediate CRLs in the signature path
	towards the trust anchor, in addition to the expiry moment of the
	leaf-CRL and CAs.
    <li>Handling of CRLs and Manifests in the face of inconsistent RRDP delta
	publications has been improved. A copy of an alternative version of
	the applicable CRL is kept in the staging area of the cache directory,
	in order to increase the potential for establishing a complete
	publication point, in cases where a single publication point update
	was smeared across multiple RRDP delta files.
    <li>The OpenBGPD configuration output now includes validated Autonomous
	System Provider Authorization (ASPA) payloads as an 'aspa-set {}'
	configuration block.
    <li>When rpki-client is invoked with increased verbosity ('-v'), the
	current RRDP Serial and Session ID are shown to aid debugging.
    <li>Self-signed X.509 certificates (such as Trust Anchor certificates)
	now are considered invalid if they contain an X.509
	AuthorityInfoAccess extension.
    <li>Signed Objects where the CMS signing-time attribute contains a
	timestamp later then the X.509 certificate's notAfter timestamp are
	considered invalid.
    <li>Manifests where the CMS signing-time attribute contains a timestamp
	later then the Manifest eContent nextUpdate timestamp are considered
	invalid.
    <li>Any objects whose CRL Distribution Points extension contains a
	CRLIssuer, CRL Reasons, or nameRelativeToCRLIssuer field are
	considered invalid in accordance with RFC 6487 section 4.8.6.
    <li>For every X.509 certificate the SHA-1 of the Subject Public Key is
	calculated and compared to the Subject Key Identifier (SKI). If a
	mismatch is found the certificate is not trusted.
    <li>Require the outside-TBS signature OID for every X.509 intermediate
	CA certificate and CRL to be sha256WithRSAEncryption.
    <li>Require the RSA key pair modulus and public exponent parameters to
	strictly conform to the RFC 7935 profile.
    <li>Ensure there is no trailing garbage present in Signed Objects beyond
	the self-embedded length field.
    <li>Require RRDP Session IDs to strictly be version 4 UUIDs.
    <li>When decoding and validating an individual RPKI file using filemode
	(rpki-client -f file), display the signature path towards the trust
	anchor and the timestamp when the signature path will expire.
    <li>When decoding and validating an individual RPKI file using filemode
	(rpki-client -f file), display the optional CMS signing-time,
	non-optional X.509 notBefore timestamp and non-optional X.509
	notAfter timestamp.
  </ul>

  <li>Updated zlib to 1.2.13.

  <li>Fixed a long-standing bug in a libreadline header that broke the
	interactive Python command line interface.

  <li>Switched <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tftpd.8">tftpd(8)</a> to
	default to read-only unless -w is specified for write access (the
	previous default).
  <li>Stopped printing the prompt for non-interactive usage of <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/tftp.1">tftp(1)</a>.
  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rarpd.8">rarpd(8)</a> to
	only unveil /tftpboot if -t is specified.
  <li>Added client certificate authentication and an optional SASL
	EXTERNAL bind to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypldap.8">ypldap(8)</a>.
  <li>Adjusted ipv6 address width to align the display columns better
	in the output of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ndp.8">ndp(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/route.8">route(8)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstat.1">netstat(1)</a> as already
	available in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/systat.1">systat(1)</a>'s netstat.
  <li>Used <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/stravis.3">stravis(3)</a> to
	sanitize redirect URIs from <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ftp.1">ftp(1)</a> fetch before printing.

  <li>Prevent an <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.8">unwind(8)</a> crash when a TCP
	query is larger than the length field indicated.
  <li>Preserve the original order of nameservers as configured via <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolv.conf.5">resolv.conf(5)</a> in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolvd.8">resolvd(8)</a>.
  <li>Restrict the characters allowed in the hostname argument of <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/getaddrinfo.3">getaddrinfo(3)</a> to the
	set [A-z0-9-_.]. Additionally, two consecutive dots ('.') are not
	allowed nor can the string start with - or '.'. This removes
	characters like '$', '`', '\n' or '*' that can traverse the DNS
	without problems but have special meaning as in a shell.
  <li>Fixed a number of out of bounds reads in DNS response parsing of
	the async DNS resolver in libc.
  <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a> -M (mac) to
	find the mac address on an interface and print it.
  <li>Added support for configuring interfaces by lladdr to support
	interface configurations bound to a specific hardware device. The "if"
	part of the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if.5">hostname.if(5)</a>
	configuration file can now be a MAC address.
  <li>Limited display of wireguard peers by <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a> to when
	either a wireguard interface is specified or the flag "-A" is used.
  <li>Implemented the RFC 8781 PREF64 router advertisement option in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rad.8">rad(8)</a> which is used to
	communicate NAT64 prefixes to hosts.
  <li>Moved the documentation of flag mappings displayed by "route show" from the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstat.1">netstat(1)</a> manpage to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/route.8">route(8)</a>.
  <li>Improvements in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Stop claiming connection success in UDP mode unless true.
    <li>Do not test the connection in non-interactive mode. The test
	writes characters to the socket which can corrupt data that is
	possibly piped into nc.
    <li>Some refactoring and code cleanup.
  </ul>

  <li>Improvements in 
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for newlines inside the alternative names block in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.conf.5">acme-client.conf(5)</a>.
    <li>Use proper data structures for retrieving subject alternative names in
	certificates rather than printing them to a buffer and tokenizing and
	parsing the undocumented string.
    <li>Simplified, corrected and modernized the use of libcrypto interfaces.
    <li>Plugged various memory leaks.
    <li>Use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_TIME_to_tm.3">ASN1_TIME_to_tm(3)</a>
	instead of a poor man's hand-rolled version of it.
    <li>Use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">timegm(3)</a>
	instead of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">mktime(3)</a>
	to eliminate time-zone variation.
    <li>Encode Subject Alternative Name (SAN) entries before printing.
    <li>Prevent <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a>
	from leaking an http get request when receiving a redirect without a
	location header.
  </ul>

  <!-- smtpd -->
  <li>Prevented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>
	abort due to a connection from a local, scoped ipv6 address.
  <li>Fixed a potential NULL dereference in the unpriv child expanding
	%{mda} in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>.
  <li>Corrected the order of arguments for calls to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/shutdown.2">shutdown(2)</a> on the route
	socket of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/slaacd.8">slaacd(8)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpleased.8">dhcpleased(8)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.8">unwind(8)</a>.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/route.8">route(8)</a>
	sourceaddr print the used addresses for inet and inet6, or "default"
	if no sourceaddr is set and the default algorithm is used.
  <li>Added -mpls option to the route(8) monitor command. It can be
	used to restrict displayed route messages to the mpls address family.
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync.1">rsync(1)</a>
	handling of port numbers in rsync://host[:port]/module URLS.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpdrop.8">tcpdrop(8)</a>
	accept netstat-style address.port syntax.
  <li>Ensured <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a>
		correctly adds addresses to the undefined/inactive table.
  <li>Switched <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tftpd.8">tftpd(8)</a> to default
	to read-only unless <code>-w</code> is specified for write access
	(the previous default).
  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rarpd.8">rarpd(8)</a> to only unveil /tftpboot if -t is specified.
  <li>Fixed the DIOCIGETIFACES ioctl so all network interfaces and
	interface groups are reported in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a>.
  </ul>

<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> improvements and bug fixes:
  <ul>
	<li>Added scroll-top and scroll-bottom <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> commands to scroll so cursor is at the top or bottom respectively.
	<li>Added a -T flag to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> capture-pane to capture up to the last used cell and not the full width of the pane.
	<li>Preserved the marked pane when renumbering windows in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>.
	<li>Added modified tab key sequences to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>.
	<li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> to only set the extended flag when searching, which allows send-keys to work.
	<li>Added a -l flag to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> display-message to disable format expansion.
	<li>Fixed a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> crash when there are no window buffers.
	<li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> C-S-Tab without extended keys.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> send-keys -K to handle keys directly as if typed.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> tty-keys accept \007 as terminator to OSC 10 or 11.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> recognize pasted texts wrapped in bracket paste sequences, rather than only forwarding to the program inside.
	<li>Supported -1 without -N for list-keys in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>.
	<li>Added a flag to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> display-menu to select the menu item chosen first.
	<li>Added Backtab key support to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>

    </ul>
  </ul>

<li>OpenSSH 9.3 and OpenSSH 9.2<br>
This release of OpenBSD includes the changes made to OpenSSH since release 9.1:
  <ul>
  <li>Security
    <ul>
    <li>ssh-add(1): when adding smartcard keys to ssh-agent(1) with the
      per-hop destination constraints (ssh-add -h ...) added in OpenSSH
      8.9, a logic error prevented the constraints from being
      communicated to the agent. This resulted in the keys being added
      without constraints. The common cases of non-smartcard keys and
      keys without destination constraints are unaffected. This problem
      was reported by Luci Stanescu.
    <li>ssh(1): Portable OpenSSH provides an implementation of the
      getrrsetbyname(3) function if the standard library does not
      provide it, for use by the VerifyHostKeyDNS feature. A
      specifically crafted DNS response could cause this function to
      perform an out-of-bounds read of adjacent stack data, but this
      condition does not appear to be exploitable beyond denial-of-service
      to the ssh(1) client.<br>
      The getrrsetbyname(3) replacement is only included if the system's
      standard library lacks this function and portable OpenSSH was not
      compiled with the ldns library (--with-ldns). getrrsetbyname(3) is
      only invoked if using VerifyHostKeyDNS to fetch SSHFP records. This
      problem was found by the Coverity static analyzer.
    <li>sshd(8): fix a pre-authentication double-free memory fault
      introduced in OpenSSH 9.1. This is not believed to be exploitable,
      and it occurs in the unprivileged pre-auth process that is
      subject to chroot(2) and is further sandboxed on most major
      platforms.
    <li>ssh(8): in OpenSSH releases after 8.7, the PermitRemoteOpen option
      would ignore its first argument unless it was one of the special
      keywords "any" or "none", causing the permission list to fail open
      if only one permission was specified. bz3515
    <li>ssh(1): if the CanonicalizeHostname and CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
      options were enabled, and the system/libc resolver did not check
      that names in DNS responses were valid, then use of these options
      could allow an attacker with control of DNS to include invalid
      characters (possibly including wildcards) in names added to
      known_hosts files when they were updated. These names would still
      have to match the CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs allow-list, so
      practical exploitation appears unlikely.
      </ul>
  <li>Potentially-incompatible changes
      <ul>
    <li>ssh(1): add a new EnableEscapeCommandline ssh_config(5) option that
      controls whether the client-side ~C escape sequence that provides a
      command-line is available. Among other things, the ~C command-line
      could be used to add additional port-forwards at runtime.<br>
      This option defaults to "no", disabling the ~C command-line that
      was previously enabled by default. Turning off the command-line
      allows platforms that support sandboxing of the ssh(1) client
      (currently only OpenBSD) to use a stricter default sandbox policy.
      </ul>
  <li>New features
      <ul>
    <li>ssh-keygen(1), ssh-keyscan(1): accept -Ohashalg=sha1|sha256 when
      outputting SSHFP fingerprints to allow algorithm selection. bz3493
    <li>sshd(8): add a `sshd -G` option that parses and prints the
      effective configuration without attempting to load private keys
      and perform other checks. This allows usage of the option before
      keys have been generated and for configuration evaluation and
      verification by unprivileged users.
    <li>sshd(8): add support for channel inactivity timeouts via a new
      sshd_config(5) ChannelTimeout directive. This allows channels that
      have not seen traffic in a configurable interval to be
      automatically closed. Different timeouts may be applied to session,
      X11, agent and TCP forwarding channels.
    <li>sshd(8): add a sshd_config UnusedConnectionTimeout option to
      terminate client connections that have no open channels for a
      length of time. This complements the ChannelTimeout option above.
    <li>sshd(8): add a -V (version) option to sshd like the ssh client has.
    <li>ssh(1): add a "Host" line to the output of ssh -G showing the
      original hostname argument. bz3343
    <li>scp(1), sftp(1): add a -X option to both scp(1) and sftp(1) to
      allow control over some SFTP protocol parameters: the copy buffer
      length and the number of in-flight requests, both of which are used
      during upload/download. Previously these could be controlled in
      sftp(1) only. This makes them available in both SFTP protocol
      clients using the same option character sequence.
    <li>ssh-keyscan(1): allow scanning of complete CIDR address ranges,
      e.g.  "ssh-keyscan 192.168.0.0/24". If a CIDR range is passed, then
      it will be expanded to all possible addresses in the range
      including the all-0s and all-1s addresses. bz#976
    <li>ssh(1): support dynamic remote port forwarding in escape
      command-line's -R processing. bz#3499
      </ul>
  <li>Bugfixes
      <ul>
    <li>scp(1), sftp(1): fix progressmeter corruption on wide displays;
      bz3534
    <li>ssh-add(1), ssh-keygen(1): use RSA/SHA256 when testing usability
      of private keys as some systems are starting to disable RSA/SHA1
      in libcrypto.
    <li>sftp-server(8): fix a memory leak. GHPR363
    <li>ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-keyscan(1): remove vestigial protocol
      compatibility code and simplify what's left.
    <li>Fix a number of low-impact Coverity static analysis findings.
      These include several reported via bz2687
    <li>ssh_config(5), sshd_config(5): mention that some options are not
      first-match-wins.
    <li>Rework logging for the regression tests. Regression tests will now
      capture separate logs for each ssh and sshd invocation in a test.
    <li>ssh(1): make `ssh -Q CASignatureAlgorithms` work as the manpage
      says it should; bz3532.
    <li>ssh(1): ensure that there is a terminating newline when adding a
      new entry to known_hosts; bz3529
    <li>ssh(1): when restoring non-blocking mode to stdio fds, restore
      exactly the flags that ssh started with and don't just clobber them
      with zero, as this could also remove the append flag from the set.
      bz3523
    <li>ssh(1): avoid printf("%s", NULL) if using UserKnownHostsFile=none
      and a hostkey in one of the system known hosts file changes.
    <li>scp(1): switch scp from using pipes to a socket-pair for
      communication with its ssh sub-processes, matching how sftp(1)
      operates.
    <li>sshd(8): clear signal mask early in main(); sshd may have been
      started with one or more signals masked (sigprocmask(2) is not
      cleared on fork/exec) and this could interfere with various things,
      e.g. the login grace timer. Execution environments that fail to
      clear the signal mask before running sshd are clearly broken, but
      apparently they do exist.
    <li>ssh(1): warn if no host keys for hostbased auth can be loaded.
    <li>sshd(8): Add server debugging for hostbased auth that is queued and
      sent to the client after successful authentication, but also logged
      to assist in diagnosis of HostbasedAuthentication problems. bz3507
    <li>ssh(1): document use of the IdentityFile option as being usable to
      list public keys as well as private keys. GHPR352
    <li>sshd(8): check for and disallow MaxStartups values less than or
      equal to zero during config parsing, rather than failing later at
      runtime.  bz3489
    <li>ssh-keygen(1): fix parsing of hex cert expiry times specified on
      the command-line when acting as a CA.
    <li>scp(1): when scp(1) is using the SFTP protocol for transport (the
      default), better match scp/rcp's handling of globs that don't match
      the globbed characters but do match literally (e.g. trying to
      transfer a file named "foo.[1]"). Previously scp(1) in SFTP mode
      would not match these pathnames but legacy scp/rcp mode would.
      bz3488
    <li>ssh-agent(1): document the "-O no-restrict-websafe" command-line
      option.
    <li>ssh(1): honour user's umask(2) if it is more restrictive then the
      ssh default (022).

<section id=quickinstall>
<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the use of
the "<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel</a> -E" command.
If you are at all confused when installing OpenBSD, read the relevant
INSTALL.* file as listed above!

<h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install73.iso</i> or
<i>cd73.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install73.iso</i> or
<i>cd73.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install73.img</i> or
<i>miniroot73.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/arm64:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>install73.img</i> or <i>miniroot73.img</i> to a disk and boot from it
after connecting to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.arm64 for more
details.

<h3>OpenBSD/armv7:</h3>

<p>
Write a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install73.iso</i> or
<i>cd73.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install73.img</i> or
<i>miniroot73.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot73.img</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot73.img</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.3/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install73.img</i> or <i>miniroot73.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install73.img</i> or <i>miniroot73.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy73.img</i> or <i>floppyB73.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot73.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.2 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade73.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=sourcecode>
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=ports>
<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_3</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.3 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
